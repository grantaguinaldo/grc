SCG-14, pgs. 24-26).  Success of the program will be measured based on achieving this objective.  As VIPP ramps up in the coming years, the program will be evaluating and addressing any constraints, such as resources, that would prevent this objective from being achieved.  Within the 25- to 30-year time frame, replacement of the early vintage plastic pipelines will be prioritized by considering such criteria as pipeline age, installation conditions, and performance.  Performance considers both completed leak repairs and leaks that are pending repair.  With the objective of wholesale replacement of early vintage plastic and the prioritized replacement strategy, the expected outcome of this program will be a reduction in leaks found, with measurable results in future years.  Because VIPP is part of the Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP), which is a mitigant to a Risk Assessment Mitigation Phase (RAMP) risk, performance metrics to quantify benefits and risk reductions are yet to be determined, such as through the future accountability reporting requirements for such, are in the ongoing Safety Model Assessment Proceeding (S-MAP), Application 15-05-002 (consolidated).
