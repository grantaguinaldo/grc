100,3,INTRODUCTION The project workpapers that follow provide detailed information regarding the forecasted cost for each of the ten Phase 1B and twelve Phase 2A projects included in this Application.
100,4,"As stated in SCG-15 the methodology used to develop these forecasted costs include components that follow the guiding principles of Stages One (Project Initiation) through Three (Begin Detailed Planning) for the Seven Stage Review process, which was established to promote efficient project execution."
100,5,Each workpaper is organized as follows to capture the key elements of the estimate: Cost and Project Summary – provides an overview of the project scope and costs.
100,6,"Alternatives Considered – for Phase 1B replacement projects, describes the options to replacement (de-rating, abandonment)."
100,7,Forecast Methodology – describes the basis of the cost estimated and the categories of costs considered in developing all project estimates.
100,8,Schedule – describes the basis for the schedule used across all project estimates.
100,9,"Project Satellite and Topographic Map – two maps are provided (when applicable): a conventional map to provide the reader with general location of the project, and a satellite map that shows the type of terrain (urban, rural, river crossings, highways, etc.) the project traverses."
100,10,"Mileage Table – the mileage for the project broken down by phase and accelerated and incidental miles, as defined in the testimony of Ronn Gonzalez in Chapter II."
100,11,Material Costs - estimate based on the type and quantities of material required for each project.
100,12,"Construction Costs – based upon input from construction contractors, assumptions made in the development of the construction component of the project, which generally account for approximately 50% of total project cost."
100,13,"General assumptions include a geographically based construction cost estimate, estimated construction schedule duration, working days and hours taking into consideration any working hour restrictions, type of pipe installation method for replacement projects, and other pertinent construction assumptions."
100,14,"Additional detailed construction information, including site mobilization/facilities, site management, material handling, traffic control, substructure location, post-construction pressure test, final pipeline tie-in, abandonment of existing pipeline, paving, site restoration, site demobilization, and construction field overhead assumptions."
100,15,"Environmental Costs - based upon evaluation of the project by PSEP Environmental Services, assumptions and associated costs regarding anticipated permitting, surveys, and monitoring, hazardous/non-hazardous waste containment/disposal, Permit fees, and mitigation fees."
100,16,Identified environmental issues unique to the project are also listed.
100,17,"Land/Right of Way Costs – assumptions include need for new easements, construction yards for the storage of material and construction trailers and associated permits and legal services."
100,18,Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP3Company Labor Costs – anticipated activity and level of effort for SoCalGas management and represented personnel in support of the project.
100,19,Other Costs – estimated costs of contracted Project Management and Engineering services.
100,20,Included in each of the above key elements are the assumptions used to form the basis of estimate.
100,21,There is contains a Glossary that will assist in defining specific terminology used throughout the workpapers.
100,22,"The Summary Table of Projects provides a summary of relevant data for each project included in this Application (Line Number, Phase, project type (replacement, pressure test, abandonment, de-rate), line type (Transmission, Distribution), costs (loaded O&M costs, loaded capital costs and total loaded costs), mileage, and diameter."
100,23,"PSEP Seven Stage Review Process1 As explained in testimony, the Seven Stage Review Process sequences and schedules PSEP project workflow deliverables.2 The Seven Stage Review Process consists of seven stages with specific objectives for each stage and an evaluation gate at the end of each stage to verify that objectives have been met before proceeding to the next stage.3 Below is a description of the common activities that occur within each stage: Stage 1 (Project Initiation) is where the Phase 1 WOA is initiated."
100,24,The Phase 1 WOA is used to track costs for the early stage investigation and validation of Category 4 Criteria mileage and to fund enough preliminary project scoping and design to develop an initial cost estimate (Phase 2 WOA).
100,25,"The Project Initiation Stage is where mileage originally included for remediation may be decreased due to scope validation efforts, reduction in Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (MAOP), or abandonment of lines that are no longer required from a gas operating system perspective."
100,26,Stage 2 (Test or Replace Analysis) is where SoCalGas and SDG&E analyze data for selection of testing or replacement and focus on achieving PSEP’s four objectives.
100,27,Project execution options are presented and considered prior to proceeding to the next stage.
100,28,1 Stages 1-3 have been completed for the projects included in this application 2 The Seven Stage Review Process was implemented by the PSEP Organization beginning in the Second Quarter of 2013.
100,29,3 Certain stages are condensed or combined for valve and small pipeline projects.
100,30,"Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP4Stage 3 (Begin Detailed Planning) is where a project execution plan is finalized, baseline schedules are developed, funding estimates are developed, and project funding is obtained."
100,31,The preliminary design estimates or Total Installed Costs (TIC) are estimated in direct dollars.
100,32,"Based on the TIC direct estimate, a Phase 2 WOA which adds in the indirects is populated."
100,33,At the end of Stage 3 a preliminary design of the project is complete.
100,34,"Stage 4 (Detailed Design/Procurement) is where design and construction documents are completed, necessary permits and authorizations are attained, a construction contractor is selected, and pipeline materials are purchased, received, and prepared for turnover to contractors."
100,35,"Stage 5 (Construction) is where construction contractors are mobilized and monitored to (1) document progress and compliance; (2) conduct testing; and (3) maintain project scope quality, budget, and schedule."
100,36,Stage 6 (Place into Service) is where commissioning and operating activities are performed to achieve completion certification for the project.
100,37,"Stage 7 (Closeout) is where regulatory, contractual, archival activities are performed to close the project in an orderly manner and issue acceptance certificates."
100,38,"Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP5WP-SCS-1-16 Standard Construction Summary for Replacement, Hydrotest, and Valve Enhancement Plan Projects Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP6Standard Construction Summary for Replacement, Hydrotest The following information provides an overview of the typical construction activities that occur during SoCalGas and PSEP pipeline replacement and hydrotest projects."
100,39,"It should be noted that there are some projects that may differ from the general activities described below, as project activities depend on the unique characteristics of each particular project."
100,40,This first section describes the typical activities of a replacement project.
100,41,The following section will discuss the differences seen in a hydrotest project as compared to a replacement project.
100,42,Replacement Project 1.
100,43,Permits – Typically Stages 3 or 4 One of the initial construction activities that affect project decisions is the securing of permits.
100,44,"PSEP projects are in a variety of locations: congested urban areas, highways/freeways, railroads/light rails, bridges, environmentally and culturally sensitive areas, coastal zone, commercial centers, private land, hillsides, airport zones, etc., and, as such, there are usually many permits required for a project."
100,45,"Each area will present unique requirements that are necessary for successful and safe construction which also must follow the specific requirements, such as requiring night work (see Figure 4), as stated in each of the specific permits pulled for a project."
100,46,Permits may take many months to secure and the requirements of the permit may not be known until construction is about to begin.
100,47,"The permits may be local, state, or federal permits and clearances and they address all natural resources — land, air, water, vegetation, and wildlife — as well as the interests of the general public such as noise."
100,48,"Some of the most common agencies involved are local municipalities, Caltrans, local tribal organizations, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Land Management, environmental agencies, etc."
100,49,2.
100,50,Surveying and Locating – Stages 3 or 4 Surveying and locating activities will typically take place during Stages 3-4 and determine the right of way (ROW) and pipeline location.
100,51,The ROW is a narrow strip of land (public or private property) that contains the pipeline(s) and is where all onsite construction activities occur.
100,52,"Before any construction activities can begin, survey and locate & mark crews carefully survey and mark out the construction right of way for the existing pipeline and other substructure locations."
100,53,"Since it is critical that the exact pipeline location and substructures are known prior to the start of construction, potholing is also typically completed during Stage 4, but there are times when this activity cannot start until Stage 5 (construction)."
100,54,Potholing involves excavating a small hole over the pipeline to validate the location of an existing substructure.
100,55,"Surveying and locating activities help to determine what will be needed for the temporary construction easements, possible substructure conflicts within the desired replacement location, and other issues that will need to be accounted for in the project design."
100,56,"In Stage 4, the land acquisition team is evaluating nearby locations for a lay-down yard and field construction office which will stage the equipment, material, fabrication space, water for hydrotests, Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP7work trailer, etc."
100,57,for several weeks.
100,58,"Ideally, the yard will be at least 50,000 square feet or about the size of a football field (See Figure 5)."
100,59,"Lastly, during Stages 3 and 4, affected customers are identified and communication materials are generated and sent out which notify customers of the upcoming construction activities in the area."
100,60,This notification takes place earlier enough in the process so as to allow for customer input and changes to construction as needed.
100,61,3.
100,62,Clearing and Grading Construction and Lay-down Yard - beginning Stage 5 At the beginning of Stage 5 (Construction) the clearing/grading activities typically take place for projects in the non-paved locations.
100,63,A few require extensive work due to work being located on hillsides.
100,64,Clearing is the removal of all brush from the construction work area.
100,65,Grading is required to provide a relatively level surface to allow safe operation of the heavy equipment.
100,66,It should be noted before any construction activity takes place an environmental inspection may be required of the laydown yard and the pipeline construction area.
100,67,4.
100,68,Trenching and Excavating – Stage 5 Trenching and excavating activity takes place in Stage 5 (Construction).
100,69,The trenching operation in pavement begins with a saw-cutting crew which cuts the pavement for excavation.
100,70,"Once the pavement is removed from the area, the trenching can begin."
100,71,The trenching crew typically uses a backhoe to dig the replacement pipe trench.
100,72,The trench is excavated to a depth that provides sufficient cover over the pipeline after backfilling.
100,73,"Typically, the trench is about 4 to 6 feet wide in stable soils and at least 5-feet deep (depends on the pipeline’s diameter and DOT Class location to actual depth)."
100,74,This depth allows for the required minimum 36 inches of cover.
100,75,Many pipelines are located at a depth which requires elaborate shoring systems to be installed for construction.
100,76,The shoring is necessary when the excavation is more than 5 feet deep or is in sandy soil conditions (see Figure 6).
100,77,The shoring can limit the work area due to beams and other structures that obstruct the construction process which slows down production (see Figure 1).
100,78,An example of why greater pipeline depth is needed is a railroad crossing or storm drain conflict.
100,79,"Given the work that needs to take place on the existing pipeline, the excavation may require, per code, hand-digging over the gas pipeline to expose the pipe and other potential utility substructures in the area."
100,80,The hand- digging process can be labor and time intensive.
100,81,"For example, if the trench that the pipeline must be installed within is running laterally with another utility structure and the distance is under the legal threshold for mechanical excavation, the entire length must be hand excavated."
100,82,There are also many requirements that have to be met during the excavation process that are governed by the various permits issued for a project.
100,83,"For example, when excavating in traveled roadways, steel plates will be needed to cover the open trench at the end of each day."
100,84,The process of moving the plates on the trench and welding them together at the end of the day and then removing them each morning takes additional time that may decrease productivity depending on the available working hours set by the permitting agency.
100,85,"Some installations require a bore operation when the pipeline needs to go under a structure and an open trench cannot be dug, for example for crossing a freeway/highway, or railroad, or to avoid disrupting traffic across a busy intersection."
100,86,"In this case, there is only an excavation at the start and end Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP8of the bore route; however, these bore pits are typically 30 feet x 15 feet and at a minimum depth of 20 feet (oftentimes greater)."
100,87,This activity requires extensive bell-hole preparation and is a complicated process that necessitates a specialized crew and equipment (see Figures 7 and 8).
100,88,"Often, each replaced pipeline has taps that feed an individual customer or a regulator station which need to be connected to the new pipeline once put into service."
100,89,Each tap location requires an excavation which is on average approximately 5 feet x 8 feet and takes a crew approximately 1 day per hole to excavate depending on the soil conditions (shoring may also be needed).
100,90,Those excavations will be plated and left open until the new pipeline section is tested and gassed up.
100,91,Then these tap connections can be completed and backfilled.
100,92,"Lastly, there are some municipalities that require the existing pipeline to be removed and the new pipeline to be installed in the same location."
100,93,This also might be necessary if the pipeline right of way is not large enough for the replacement pipeline.
100,94,This removal step can greatly add to the complexity and time for the project.
100,95,5.
100,96,"Pipeline Laying, Bending, Welding - Stage 5 The pipe sections, fittings and other pipeline components are laid out on the job site for installation as construction proceeds."
100,97,In order to follow the correct route the pipe’s direction is changed by either bends or welding in segmented ells (see Figure 9).
100,98,In some cases the joints are welded together and placed on temporary supports.
100,99,The pipe crew and a welding crew are responsible for the welding process.
100,100,"The pipe crew typically uses special pipeline equipment called side booms to pick up each joint of pipe, align it with another joint, and make the first part of the weld (a pass called the stringer bead)."
100,101,Additional filler passes are made by welders who immediately follow the stringer bead.
100,102,"There could be different welders for the different welds needed: stringer, hot-pass, and capping welders make up the typical welding crew, and they are often followed by tie-in welders."
100,103,6.
100,104,"Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) - Stage 5 As part of the quality assurance process, each welder must pass qualification tests (Operator Qualification) to work on a particular pipeline job, and each weld procedure must be approved for use on that job in accordance with federally adopted welding standards."
100,105,"The welds undergo visual and radiographic inspection (a.k.a., X-ray), as outlined in 49 CFR Part 192 by qualified technicians and inspectors."
100,106,The technicians take X-rays of the pipe welds to ensure that the completed welds meet federally prescribed quality standards.
100,107,"The X-ray technician processes the film in a small, portable darkroom at the site."
100,108,"If the technician detects any unacceptable flaws, the weld is repaired or cut out, and a new weld is made as per code requirements."
100,109,7.
100,110,"Lowering Pipe into the Trench - Stage 5 Depending on the length of pipe to replace, lowering the welded pipe into the trench demands close coordination and skilled operators (see Figure 9)."
100,111,"Using a series of side booms (tractor designed to move pipelines into place), operators simultaneously lift and carefully lower the welded pipe sections into the trench."
100,112,The bottom of the trench is shaded with at least 6 inches of sand to protect the pipe and coating from damage.
100,113,"Lastly, cathodic protection test stations may be installed on the pipeline before backfilling."
100,114,Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP98.
100,115,Field Coating - Stage 5 Pipelines are externally coated to prevent moisture from coming into direct contact with the steel and causing corrosion.
100,116,"Typically, coated pipelines are delivered with uncoated areas three to six inches from each end to prevent the coating from interfering with the welding process."
100,117,"Once the welds are completed, a coating crew coats the remaining portion of the pipeline."
100,118,"Prior to this coating application, the coating crew thoroughly cleans the bare pipe with a power wire brush or a sandblast machine to remove any dirt, mill scale, or debris."
100,119,The crew then applies the coating and allows it to dry.
100,120,"Once dry, the coating of the pipeline is inspected to ensure it is free of defects: it is electronically inspected, or “jeeped,” for faults or voids in the epoxy coating and visually inspected for faults, scratches, or other coating defects."
100,121,9.
100,122,"Backfilling and Paving - Stage 5 After all welds have passed NDE, coating is completed and passes inspection, and survey crews record the location of the pipe and various valves/fittings, crews begin the backfilling process."
100,123,"As with previous construction crews, the backfilling crew takes care to protect the pipeline and coating by using a minimum of 12 inches of zero-sack slurry (sand and water mixture) on top of the top pipe."
100,124,Then the remainder of the backfill material is placed over the pipe.
100,125,The final step is paving.
100,126,10.
100,127,"Hydrostatic Testing - Stage 5 Depending on the varying elevation of the terrain along the pipeline and the location of available water sources, the pipeline may be divided into sections to facilitate the test."
100,128,Each section is filled with water and pressured up to DOT requirements and held for a specified period of time to determine if the pipeline meets the design strength requirements and if any leaks are present (see Figures 10 and 11 for hydrotest set ups).
100,129,"Once a section successfully passes the hydrostatic test, water is emptied from the pipeline and the pipeline is dried to ensure that no water is present when natural gas begins to flow."
100,130,The drying out of the pipeline is completed using large compressors and foam tools (pigs).
100,131,A pig launcher and receiver are installed at the ends to facilitate this process.
100,132,The team will continue to pass the pig through the system until the desired dew point is reached as prescribed by engineering.
100,133,"Once achieved, the final tie-ins and commissioning activities can commence."
100,134,"This drying process usually takes 3 days, more or less depending on the length and geometry of the pipeline."
100,135,The used water is tested by environmental services for disposal purposes.
100,136,"Containers such as Baker Tanks are used to store the water before disposal while water testing results are being evaluated (see Figures 10, 11, and 12)."
100,137,Filtration equipment is used to remove organic and inorganic material to permit disposal levels.
100,138,"The water may be disposed of at a sewer, transported to a disposal facility via a truck or provided to a third party for non- potable reuse."
100,139,How the water is disposed often times depends on permit requirements.
100,140,11.
100,141,"Final Tie-in and commissioning - Stage 5 and 6 Following successful hydrostatic testing and drying process, the final pipeline tie-ins are made and inspected (see Figure 13)."
100,142,The line is then odorized which is a process that will take up to 2 days or more to complete.
100,143,"After odorization is achieved, the tie-in process is completed with flow being opened to all taps."
100,144,Any customers who were being fed by CNG/LNG have their service switched to being fed from the new pipeline.
100,145,Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP10The process for the abandonment of the original line also needs to take place.
100,146,"It begins by purging, isolating the ends and taps, and permanently decommissioning the line which could take a few days to complete."
100,147,12.
100,148,"Cleanup and Restoration - Stage 5 and 6 The final step in the construction process is to restore the street, right-of-way, easement land and lay-down yard as closely as possible to its original condition."
100,149,"This step involves cleaning up the lay-down yard, completing the paving repairs or land restoration as required by the issued permit or land owner."
100,150,Careful attention is paid to ensure future erosion issues are addressed for non-paving involved installations.
100,151,This next section describes the hydrotest project activities as they differ from a pipeline replacement project.
100,152,Hydrotest Project a.
100,153,The trenching/excavating activity for a hydrotest project will involve exposing the pipeline to be tested as follows: b.
100,154,Identified pipeline features will be removed.
100,155,The removal process in general will also involve welding and NDE (see Figure 14).
100,156,c.
100,157,All non-piggable pipeline features will be removed.
100,158,d.
100,159,All pipeline features that cannot be pressure tested will be replaced/removed.
100,160,e.
100,161,"All tap locations (customer lines, regulator station taps, etc.) that are off the main line will be excavated because they need to be isolated before a hydrotest."
100,162,f.
100,163,Each end of the project will be exposed to install test heads.
100,164,This will require a minimum of a 10 foot x 20 foot bell hole.
100,165,There is a small amount of replacement work during a hydrotest project that is necessary to isolate the pipe and install the test heads.
100,166,This replacement activity requires the following: a.
100,167,The small section of pipe is removed at each end.
100,168,b.
100,169,The non-tested line must be welded with a cap that will be cut out after testing is completed.
100,170,c.
100,171,The test heads are welded into place and NDE follows.
100,172,d.
100,173,The pipe is hydrotested.
100,174,e.
100,175,The test heads are cut out and the pig launcher/receiver is installed.
100,176,The drying process takes place after water is removed f.
100,177,The pig launcher/receiver is removed and a new tested section of pipe is installed.
100,178,All taps and main line ties are completed using the welding process.
100,179,"Lastly, since the pipeline is being taken out of service, there could be CNG/LCG activities: deliveries, installation, management and eventually removal required for the individual customers fed off the pipeline being tested (see Figure 15)."
100,180,See the following link for a video describing the process.
100,181,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRFWeTRAcCU Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP11https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRFWeTRAcCUThe following section describes the PSEP valve enhancement project activities (retrofits or new valve installations/stations) as they differ from a pipeline replacement project.
100,182,PSEP Valve Enhancement Project a) Some work will occur on SoCalGas and SDGE property which will not always necessitate obtaining a permit.
100,183,"The permits that are obtained may be for assets underground, aboveground or both."
100,184,The valve work may involve obtaining new ROW or easements agreements for installations in new locations.
100,185,"The aboveground work could be extensive with the commissioning of buildings and other structures to house communications, data panels, etc."
100,186,"(see Figure 17) b) For the valve enhancement projects submitted in this application, they are located in both city streets and in the rural areas."
100,187,"The urban valve locations typically require additional assembly space which is frequently larger than the given ROW rights; and therefore, land acquisition activity presents a greater challenge as compared to pipeline work in the streets (see Figure 18)."
100,188,c) The survey and locating activities will include potholing to confirm the depth and alignment of the pipe/valve assembly.
100,189,"Also, the distances of the valve/pipe from sidewalks or other areas will be determined."
100,190,This information is critical to the vault and actuator designs because of the varying heights and horizontal space requirements for the equipment.
100,191,"At times, these activities may determine whether a pipeline needs to be relocated to accommodate a valve installation/retrofit."
100,192,"Lastly, depending on the type of project installation, land may need to be purchased in order to accommodate facilities such as a large valve station that will include small buildings, communication installations, and other structures."
100,193,d) Each valve enhancement project involves significant excavation work that differs from hydrotests or replacement projects.
100,194,Below is a list of possible excavations that may take place on a valve enhancement project: • Expose the existing valve assembly (all sides) and for the installation of a new vault.
100,195,• Install a new valve location and associated vault.
100,196,• Remove pipeline features as required.
100,197,• Bring in new power/communications lines.
100,198,• Install gas control gas piping for sensing functions.
100,199,• Prepare the foundation for retaining wall installations for cabinets or to secure the entire facility.
100,200,"• Install line break cabinets, SCADA buildings, and antennae poles."
100,201,• Install looped grounding systems in the valve station.
100,202,e) Hydrotesting will occur on any new valve assemblies.

100,252,** Individual component tables display total direct costs (Capital and O&M).
100,253,Project Description The Line 235 West Section 1 project will hydrostatically test 24.637 miles of pipe.
100,254,"L-235 West Section 1 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1957."
100,255,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,256,"The project is located in San Bernardino, CA, beginning at the Newberry Station, continuing west towards the City of Victorville, CA, ending on the west side of Barstow Road."
100,257,The project consists of 24.356 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.281 miles of incidental pipe.
100,258,"The incidental pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing the excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work."
100,259,This project is divided into 47 individual test sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.
100,260,"The lowest and highest elevations are 1,916 feet and 4,527 feet, respectively."
100,261,The capital scope of work includes the replacement of 48 short sections of pipe and remediation of 16 identified anomalies to facilitate the Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP30hydrotesting procedure.
100,262,"This capital work totals to 2,656 feet."
100,263,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-235, L-235 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system."
100,264,"Abandoning this line would create a substantial loss in capacity to the Northern Transmission Zone since gas moves from the receiving points North and South of Needles, CA towards the Adelanto, CA via L-235 and L-235 West."
100,265,"The gas supply from Adelanto supports the entire SoCalGas Transmission System, which serves the Los Angeles Basin Loop from one or more of the City Gates."
100,266,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,267,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,268,"Shut-In Analysis Line 235 West Section 1 can be temporarily taken out of service for pressure testing, so long as L-335 remains fully in service between Quigley, CA and Adelanto, and no other outages are in effect for the duration of the hydrotest."
100,269,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,270,There are six taps that will require isolation from L-235 West prior to the shutdown.
100,271,"One of the taps is a regulator station bridled to Line 1004 in Newberry Station, three of the taps are not in service or abandoned, and the last two taps are for cathodic protection rectifiers."
100,272,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,273,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,274,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,275,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,276,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,277,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.
100,278,"As described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 152 working days."

100,306,Project Description The Line 235 West (L-235 West) Section 2 project will hydrostatically test 20.348 miles of pipe.
100,307,"L-235 West Section 2 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1957."
100,308,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,309,"The project is located in San Bernardino, CA, beginning on the east side of Sawtooth Canyon, continuing west ending on the east side of the Mojave River span."
100,310,The project consists of 18.865 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 1.483 miles of incidental pipe.
100,311,"The incidental pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work."
100,312,This project is divided into 27 hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.
100,313,"The lowest and highest elevations are 2,681 feet and 4,039 feet, respectively."
100,314,The capital scope of work includes the replacement of 28 short sections of pipe and four anomalies to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.
100,315,"This capital work totals to 1,496 feet."
100,316,"Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP48Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-235, L-235 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system."
100,317,"Abandoning this line would create a substantial loss in capacity to the Northern Transmission Zone since gas moves from the receiving points North and South of Needles, CA towards the Adelanto, CA via L-235 and L-235 West."
100,318,"The gas supply from Adelanto supports the entire SoCalGas Transmission System, which serves the Los Angeles Basin Loop from one or more of the City Gates."
100,319,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,320,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,321,"Shut-In Analysis Line 235 West Section 1 can be temporarily taken out of service for pressure testing, so long as L-335 remains fully in service between Quigley, CA and Adelanto, and no other outages are in effect for the duration of the hydrotest."
100,322,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,323,There are five taps that will require isolation from L-235 West prior to the shutdown.
100,324,"One of the taps is not in service or abandoned, two taps are for cathodic protection rectifiers, the remaining two taps will require Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) support."
100,325,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,326,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,327,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,328,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,329,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,330,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.
100,331,"As described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 120 working days."

100,354,** Individual component tables display total direct costs (Capital and O&M).
100,355,Project Description The Line 235 West Section 3 project will hydrostatically test 26.884 miles of pipe.
100,356,"L-235 West Section 3 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1957."
100,357,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,358,"The project is located in San Bernardino, CA, beginning in Adelanto, CA, continuing west ending at the Littlerock Station."
100,359,"The project consists of 26.537 miles of Phase 2A pipe, 0.086 of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.261 miles of incidental pipe."
100,360,"The incidental pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work."
100,361,This project is divided into six hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.
100,362,"The lowest and highest elevations are 2,762 feet and 3,092 feet, respectively."
100,363,The capital scope of work includes pipe that will be replaced at the end of test break 6 to avoid installing a test head inside Littlerock Station and the replacement of six short sections of pipe (totaling 132 feet) to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.
100,364,This capital Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP64work totals to 223 feet.
100,365,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-235, L-235 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system."
100,366,"Abandoning this line would create a substantial loss in capacity to the Northern Transmission Zone since gas moves from the receiving points North and South of Needles, CA towards the Adelanto, CA via L-235 and L-235 West."
100,367,"The gas supply from Adelanto supports the entire SoCalGas Transmission System, which serves the Los Angeles Basin Loop from one or more of the City Gates."
100,368,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,369,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,370,"Shut-In Analysis Line 235 West Section 3 can be temporarily taken out of service for pressure testing, so long as Line 335 (L-335) remains fully in service between Quigley, CA and Adelanto and no other outages are in effect for the duration of the hydrotest."
100,371,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,372,There are 19 taps and one crossover that will need to be isolated from L-235 West prior to the shutdown.
100,373,"Five of the taps are not in service or abandoned, three are bridled with L-335 and will require isolation from L-235 West, and the remaining eleven taps are unbridled and will require Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)."
100,374,One of the taps that require CNG support is a Regulator Station that supplies a Pressure District with a single feed line that serves multiple industrial customers.
100,375,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,376,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,377,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,378,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,379,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,380,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.
100,381,"As described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 76 working days."

100,405,Project Description The Line 407 project will hydrostatically test 3.972 miles of pipe.
100,406,"L-407 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1951."
100,407,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,408,"The L-407 project is located in Los Angeles County, CA, beginning in Tarzana, CA, continuing south ending in Sullivan Canyon in Los Angeles, CA."
100,409,The project consists of 3.959 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.013 miles of incidental pipe.
100,410,The incidental was included improve safety by moving one of the tie-in locations away from a main street do a more isolated location and constructability by relocating another tie-in point to a location that would provide adequate space for the construction team.
100,411,This project is divided into two individual test sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.
100,412,"The lowest and highest elevations are 600 feet and 1,890 feet, respectively."
100,413,The capital scope on this project includes replacement of three short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.
100,414,This capital work totals to 69 feet.
100,415,Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP78Alternatives Considered Line 407 plays a critical role in meeting the operational needs of the SoCalGas transmission system transporting gas from the northern portion of the Los Angeles Basin to the southern portion.
100,416,The abandonment of this section would result in a loss in capacity.
100,417,"Because of this, abandonment is not an option."
100,418,Derating to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet system demand and also is not an option Shut-In Analysis Line 407 can be temporarily taken out of service during the summer months as long as L-3003 remains in service.
100,419,There are no customers within the hydrotest segment therefore no CNG support will be required.
100,420,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,421,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,422,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,423,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,424,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."

100,447,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,448,"The Line 1011 is located in Ventura County, CA, beginning near the intersection of Ventura Avenue and Rocklite Road in Ventura, CA, continuing across the Ventura Mountains and ending on Hall Canyon Road."
100,449,The project consists of 1.495 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.278 miles of incidental pipe.
100,450,"The incidental included to improve constructability by minimizing the excavations, test-breaks, and tie-in work."
100,451,The project is divided into two individual test sections to address the existence of an above ground span.
100,452,Testing through the span would require additional pipe supports and modifications to the bends at the beginning and end of the pipeline span.
100,453,The span can be removed from scope because it was installed in 1995 and there are valid test records from that project.
100,454,The capital scope of this project includes the replacement of the four short sections of pipe and 11 un-piggable bends to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure and future in-line inspections.

100,485,Project Description The Line 2000 Chino Hills project will hydrostatically test 9.998 miles of pipe.
100,486,"L-2000 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1947."
100,487,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,488,The L-2000 project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 117.6 miles.
100,489,"To more efficiently execute this large project, L-2000 was divided into the following projects: L-2000-A, L-2000-Bridge, L-2000-C, L-2000 Chino Hills, L-2000-D, L-2000-E, L-2000 East of Cactus City, and L-2000-West."
100,490,"The project is located in Orange County, CA, and Riverside County, CA, beginning just west of the Prado Dam, continuing west through the Chino Hills State Park towards the City of Brea, CA."
100,491,The project consists of 9.982 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.016 miles of incidental pipe.
100,492,"The incidental pipe is included to improve constructability by minimizing the excavations, test-breaks and tie-in work."
100,493,The project is divided into 34 individual sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.
100,494,"The lowest and highest elevations are 560 feet and 1,650 feet, respectively."
100,495,"The capital work of this project includes the Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP100replacement of 37 short sections of pipe, six taps, and remediation of four anomalies to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure."
100,496,"This capital work totals to 2,105 feet."
100,497,Alternatives Considered Line 2000 is a backbone line that plays a critical role in meeting the operational needs of the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe and Spence Street Station.
100,498,The abandonment of this section of L-2000 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,499,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,500,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,501,Shut-In Analysis The line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer .
100,502,There are several customers within the hydrotest segment that must be considered before an outage could be implemented.
100,503,"Prior to shutting in the line, the customers within the isolated section will be connected and supplied with (CNG) during the outage."
100,504,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,505,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,506,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,507,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,508,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,509,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.
100,510,"As described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 141 working days."

100,529,Project Description The Line 2000-E project will hydrostatically test 8.884 miles of .
100,530,"L-2000 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1947."
100,531,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,532,The L-2000 project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 117.6 miles.
100,533,"To more efficiently execute this large project, L-2000 was divided into the following projects: L-2000-A, L-2000-Bridge, L-2000-C, L-2000 Chino Hills, L-2000-D, L-2000-E, L-2000 Blythe to Cactus City, and L-2000-West."
100,534,"The project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at the Cactus City Compressor Station, continuing west towards Indio."
100,535,The project consists of 8.756 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.128 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe.
100,536,"The Phase 2B pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work."
100,537,This project is divided into five hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.
100,538,"The lowest and highest elevations are 1,000 feet and 1,700 feet, respectively."
100,539,The capital scope of work includes the replacement of pipe under the I-10 freeway utilizing a slick and bore and the replacement of six short sections Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP115of pipe to facilitate the hydrotest procedure.
100,540,The segment under the I-10 freeway is being replaced to mitigate the risk associated with a pipeline failure due to a pipeline anomaly.
100,541,This capital work totals to 640 feet.
100,542,"Alternatives Considered Line 2000 is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,543,"The abandonment of this section of L-2000 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,544,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option."
100,545,Shut-In Analysis The line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.
100,546,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,547,"During the outage, customers served by regulator stations within the isolated section will be supplied by L-2001 which is bridled to L-2000 at those locations."
100,548,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,549,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,550,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven-stage project life cycle described in testimony.

100,613,Project Description The Line 2001 West-C project will hydrostatically test 13.853 miles of pipe.
100,614,"L-2000 West is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1953."
100,615,The pipeline has a MAOP of psig.
100,616,The L-2001W project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 64.1 miles.
100,617,"To more efficiently execute this large project, L-2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-2001W-B, L-2001W-C, L-2001W-D, and L-2001W-E."
100,618,"This project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning west of Indio, CA, continuing west ending at the Whitewater Station."
100,619,The project consists of 13.830 miles of Phase 2A pipe and .023 miles of incidental pipe.
100,620,"The incidental pipe has been included to facilitate constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work."
100,621,This project is divided into 13 hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes and Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP144environmental impact mitigation.
100,622,"The lowest and highest elevations are 120 feet and 1,090 feet, respectively."
100,623,The capital scope of work includes the replacement of four taps and 16 short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotest procedure.
100,624,"Additionally, 237 feet of pipe will be replaced east of Whitewater station following the Decision Tree methodology for segments of pipe under 1,000 feet."
100,625,This capital work totals to 877 feet.
100,626,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,627,The abandonment of this section of L-2001W would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,628,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,629,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option."
100,630,Shut-In Analysis The line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.
100,631,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,632,"During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which is bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project."
100,633,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,634,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,635,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,636,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,637,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,638,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.
100,639,"As described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 141 working days."

100,652,"Project Description The Line 2001 West-D (L-2001W-D) project will hydrostatically test 17.843 miles of Line 2000 West is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1950."
100,653,This portion of the pipeline has a MAOP of psig.
100,654,The L-2001W project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 64.1 miles.
100,655,"To more efficiently execute this large project, Line 2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-2001W-B, L-2001W-C, L-2001W-D, and L-2001W-E."
100,656,"The project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at the at Whitewater Station, continuing west to the Moreno Small Station."
100,657,"The consists of 16.341 miles of Phase 2A pipe, 0.825 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.677 miles of incidental pipe."
100,658,"The incidental pipe has been included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work."
100,659,"Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP156This project is divided into 16 hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations, pipeline accessibility issues, and environmental impact mitigation."
100,660,"The lowest and highest elevations are 1,070 feet and 2,370 feet, respectively."
100,661,"The capital scope of work includes the replacement of one tap, 21 short sections of pipe, and two anomalies to facilitate the hydrotest procedure."
100,662,The capital work totals to 840 feet.
100,663,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,664,The abandonment of this section of L-2001W would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,665,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,666,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option."
100,667,Shut-In Analysis The line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.
100,668,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,669,"During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which is bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project."
100,670,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,671,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,672,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,673,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,674,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,675,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.

100,697,Project Description The Line 2001 West-E project will hydrostatically test 8.880 miles of pipe.
100,698,"L-2001 West is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1953."
100,699,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,700,The L-2001W project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 64.1 miles.
100,701,"To more efficiently execute this large project, L-2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-2001W-B, L-2001W-C, L-2001W-D, and L-2001W-E The project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at Cactus City Compressor Station, continuing west towards Indio."
100,702,The project consists of 8.828 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.052 accelerated miles of Phase 2B pipe which are located within the Phase 2A sections.
100,703,This project is divided into five hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes and environmental impact mitigation.
100,704,"The lowest and highest elevations are 1,020 feet and 1,880 feet, respectively."
100,705,Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP168The capital work includes the replacement of six short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotest procedure.
100,706,The capital work totals to 240 feet.
100,707,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,708,The abandonment of this section of L-2001W would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,709,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,710,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option."
100,711,Shut-In Analysis The line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.
100,712,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,713,"During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which is bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project."
100,714,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,715,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,716,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,717,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,718,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,719,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.

100,785,Project Description The Line 85 project will install 13.030 miles of pipe.
100,786,"L-85 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1931."
100,787,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,788,"The project is located in Kern County, CA, beginning west of Elk Hills Road and continuing southeast to Lake Station."
100,789,"The replacement consists of 9.358 Phase 1B miles, 0.014 miles of Phase 2A, and 3.658 miles of incidental pipe."
100,790,"Of the incidental pipe, 1.004 miles is included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, and tie-in work."
100,791,The remaining 2.654 miles of incidental pipe is due to re-routes related to a new alignment.
100,792,This route minimizes impact to property owners and established farmlands along the existing route.
100,793,The majority of the pipe will be installed via open trench.
100,794,"Approximately 2,400 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) across the California Aqueduct."
100,795,The use of conventional bore technique will be utilitized to cross existing draingaes along the proposed alignment.
100,796,Approximately 900 feet of the new pipeline will be installed via conventional bore to avoid impacts to jurisdictional drainages.
100,797,"One casing bore is proposed for the new pipeline to cross State Highway 119, approximately 93 feet long."
100,798,"Below is additional scope included within the installation of the new L-85: • New receiver assembly for in-line inspection • A new MLV and bridle assembly will be located at Valley West Road and Airport Road on the east side of Airport Road • The existing regulator station located at Valley West Road and Elk Hills Road will be abandoned and a new regulator station will be installed at the new MLV site • A new 6” lateral pipeline, approximately 1 mile in length, will be installed at the new MLV site to connect to existing L-103 • A new MLV and bridle assemply located west of Gerald Street will be tied into existing L-7053 • A new regulator station will be installed at the intersection of Gerald Street and Isaac Road to replace existing station • L-8110 will be tied over to the new L-85 pipeline • A new MLV and bridle assembly at Lake Station Road will replace the existing valve • The bridle assembly will tie over to existing SL-38-283 and approximately 1,200 feet of pipe will be installed on Lake Station Road to connect to existing L-7049 Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP191• New MLV and bridle assembly at Lake Station to connect to existing L-203 • A new launcher assembly will be installed for In-Line Inspection Alternatives Considered This section of L-85 is the sole source of supply to numerous core and large non-core customers, as well as the primary source of supply for multiple distribution and transmission systems including the San Joaquin Valley and Coastal areas."
100,799,Abandoning this line would prevent these customers from being serviced.
100,800,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,801,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,802,Shut-In Analysis Line 85 will not be taken out of service during the install.
100,803,Pressure Control Fittings (PCF’s) will be utilized for the tie in of L-85 and all additional tie-ins will be complete and the new line will be active before the existing line is taken out of service.
100,804,There is no need for CNG support with this project.
100,805,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,806,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,807,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.

100,826,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,827,"The project is located in San Luis Obispo County, CA, west of the city of Santa Margarita, CA, west of Highway 101, continuing southeast parallel to Highway 101 ending just southeast of the intersection of Highway 58 and Highway 101."
100,828,"The replacement consists of 0.686 miles of Phase 1B pipe, 0.192 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.026 miles of incidental pipe."
100,829,The incidental pipe has been included to improve constructability by providing a better tie-in point and easing site accessibility.
100,830,"The project takes place in a rural area, 0.438 miles of pipe will be installed using the open trench method."
100,831,"Approximately 2,305 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD)."
100,832,The use of HDD is required to cross underneath the Santa Margarita Creek as well as the surrounding trees and rugged terrain.
100,833,The utilization of HDD resulted in the a more direct route which shortened the alignment by 0.029 miles.
100,834,Alternatives Considered Supply Line 36-9-09 North Section 12 is a critical line within the coastal distribution system and is the major supply line for customers in the area.
100,835,Abandoning this line would result in an inability to meet needs of customers in the Central Coast.
100,836,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,837,Derating this section of SL-36-9-09 North to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand during peak seasons and also is not an option.
100,838,Shut-In Analysis Supply Line 36-9-09 North Section 12 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions.

100,862,"The project is located in San Luis Obispo County, CA in the city of Santa Margarita, CA."
100,863,"The replacement consists of 1.755 miles of Phase 1B pipe, 0.001 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.059 miles of incidental pipe."
100,864,"Of the incidental pipe, 0.027 miles is included to facilitate construction."
100,865,The remaining 0.132 miles of incidental pipe is due to a re-route that follows an existing access road to minimize the impact to environmentally sensitive areas.
100,866,The proposed re-route also allows for safer monitoring and maintenance of the pipeline compared to the existing route.
100,867,The project is in a rural area and 1.765 miles of the pipe will be installed using the open trench method.
100,868,Approximately 615 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).
100,869,"The use of HDD is required to cross underneath a stream, trees, and rugged terrain."
100,870,Approximately 175 feet will be installed via slick bore under a railroad crossing.
100,871,Alternatives Considered Supply Line 36-9-09 North Section 14 is a critical line within the coastal distribution system and is the major supply line for customers in the area.
100,872,Abandoning this line would result in an inability to meet needs of customers in the Central Coast.
100,873,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,874,Derating this section of SL-36-9-09 North to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand during peak seasons and also is not an option.
100,875,Shut-In Analysis Supply Line 36-9-09 North Section 14 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions.
100,876,The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF).
100,877,There one customer located within this replacement.

100,904,"The replacement consists of 1.075 miles of Phase 1B pipe, 0.032 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.424 miles of incidental pipe."
100,905,The incidental pipe is due to a re-route.
100,906,The re-route is necessary due to the existing route being congested with other utilities and there is no room to add a new pipeline.
100,907,"The re-route will follow an existing, paved county road to minimize impact to environmentally sensitive areas."
100,908,The proposed re-route also allows safer monitoring and maintenance of the pipeline when compared to the existing route.
100,909,The project is in a rural area and 1.465 miles of pipe will be installed using the open trench method.
100,910,Approximately 350 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).
100,911,The use of HDD is required to cross the San Luis Obispo Creek at the south end of the replacement.
100,912,Alternatives Considered Supply Line 36-9-09 North Section 15 is a critical line within the coastal distribution system and is the major supply line for customers in the area.
100,913,Abandoning this line would result in an inability to meet needs of customers in the Central Coast.
100,914,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,915,Derating this section of SL-36-9-09 North to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand during peak seasons and also is not an option.
100,916,Shut-In Analysis Supply Line 36-9-09 North Section 15 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions.
100,917,The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF).
100,918,There is one customer that will be supplied with CNG during the tie-in.

100,981,Project Description The Supply Line 36-1032 Section 11 Replacement project will install 0.494 miles of pipe.
100,982,"SL-36-1032 Section 11 is a high-pressure pipeline, this portion was installed in 1939 and 1940."
100,983,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,984,"The project is located in Santa Barbara County, CA south of Orcutt, CA."
100,985,The project consists of 0.411 miles of Phase 1B pipe and 0.083 miles of incidental pipe.
100,986,The incidental pipe was due to a re-route along Highway 135 to meet Caltrans requirements.
100,987,The project is located in a rural area and the majority of the installation will be done via open trench.
100,988,Approximately 482 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).
100,989,The use of HDD is required to cross Highway 135.
100,990,Two jack-and-bores will also be utilized.
100,991,"One of approximately 90 feet and one of approximately 60 feet, both are to install the line across two creeks."
100,992,Two existing valves will be replaced with new ball valves.
100,993,Alternatives Considered Supply Line 36-1032 Section 11 is a critical line with Santa Barbara County and is a major supply line for customers in the area.
100,994,Abandoning this section would create a substantial loss in capacity and would result in an inability to meet the needs of customers in Santa Barbara County during the winter months as the system relies on the combined north and south feeds of SL-36-1032.
100,995,"Additionally, SL-36-1032 is the sole feed to SL-36-9-04 which serves a critical customer."
100,996,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,997,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,998,Shut-In Analysis SL-36-1032 Section 11 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions.
100,999,The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF’s).
100,1000,There are no customer taps along the proposed replacement therefore no CNG support will be required for this project.
100,1001,Customers downstream from this section can be temporarily back fed by the existing network.
100,1002,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.

100,1141,"SL-44-1008 is a high pressure pipeline, this portion was installed in 1937."
100,1142,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,1143,The original pipe diameter is and the replacement pipe diameter will be upsized to in order to meet the increased system demand and to improve reliability.
100,1144,"The total estimated direct cost of this project is $87,828,484, $11,246,653 of which is due to the upsizing of the pipeline to ."
100,1145,"The region will fund the cost of the upsizing, PSEP will fund the remaining $76,581,831."
100,1146,Any additional costs related to the upsizing of the pipeline will also be funded by the region.
100,1147,PSEP will fund any additional costs not related to the increase in the diameter of the pipeline.
100,1148,"The project is located in Kings County, CA, Kern County, CA and San Luis Obispo County, CA, beginning south of the City of Avenal, CA in Kings County continues southwest ending in the City of Atascadero, CA."
100,1149,It will generally follow a 25-foot offset from the existing pipeline.
100,1150,"The replacement consists of 49.849 miles of Phase 1B pipe, 0.118 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe and 4.892 miles of incidental pipe."
100,1151,Of the incidental pipe 3.556 miles is due to re-routes to minimize impact to property owners and established farmland along the existing route.
100,1152,The remaining 1.336 miles are located within the project boundaries and are due to various relocations over the years.
100,1153,"Including these sections of incidental mileage improves constructability by minimizing the excavations, and tie-in work."
100,1154,The project is primarily in rural areas and the majority of the pipe will be installed via open trench.
100,1155,Approximately 2.5 miles will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).
100,1156,"The use of HDD over these 2.5 miles are for various crossings, there are a total of 27 separate instances where HDD with be utilized."
100,1157,"Additionally, approximately 1,200 feet will be installed using a slick bore method."
100,1158,The slick bore method is being utilized to avoid open trenching in environmentally sensitive areas and in Caltrans’ right of way.
100,1159,There are nine planned slick bores.
100,1160,Alternatives Considered SL-44-1008 is the primary feed for the area and is critical in supporting customers in the region.
100,1161,"Abandoning this line would create a substantial loss in capacity to the Kings, Kern and San Luis Obispo Counties and would result in an inability to meet the needs of customers in the area."
100,1162,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1163,1SoCalGas’ showing includes 50% of the estimated project costs.
100,1164,"If the Commission grants SoCalGas’ request for a fourth year to the GRC cycle, the entire estimated projects costs for 44-1008 would be included as the entire project is anticipated to be placed into service in 2022."
100,1165,"This supplemental workpaper details the cost of the entire project Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP284Therefore, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1166,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,1167,Shut-In Analysis SL-44-1008 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions with summer conditions being preferred.
100,1168,"There is one regulator station that supplies approximately 12,000 customers and 14 customer taps within the segment."
100,1169,"Prior to shutting in the line, these 14 customers and the regulator station will be connected and supplied with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) during the tie-in, they will then be tied into the new line."
100,1170,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,1171,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,1172,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,1173,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,1174,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,1175,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.

100,1189,"Additionally, 510 feet of blow-off piping, crossover piping, and bridle piping associated with this L-2000 and L-2001-W crossover that is within the Cactus City Compressor Station will be replaced."
100,1190,This project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 117.6 miles.
100,1191,"To more efficiently execute this large project, L-2000 was divided into the following projects: L-2000-A, L-2000-Bridge, L-2000-C, L-2000 Chino Hills, L-2000-D, L-2000-E, L-2000-E Cactus City Station, L-2000 East of Cactus City, and L-2000-West."
100,1192,"This project is located in Riverside County, CA inside of the Cactus City Compressor Station."
100,1193,The replacement consists of 821 feet of Phase 2A pipe and 62 feet of incidental pipe.
100,1194,The incidental pipe has been included to increase safety during construction and to minimize tie-in work.
100,1195,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W and L-2000 are primary feeds to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,1196,The abandonment of this section of L-2001W and /or L-2000 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,1197,"Additionally, the Cactus City Compressor Station consists of main line block valves, cross-over piping, blow-off piping, and bridle piping, that provide the necessary operational flexibility to the SoCalGas transmission system."
100,1198,"Finally, the block valves and blow off piping satisfy the necessary main line valve spacing and pipeline blow-down requirements as per CPUC safety guidelines."
100,1199,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1200,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option."
100,1201,Shut-In Analysis This portion of L-2000 and L-2001 West can be temporarily taken out of service.
100,1202,There are no customer taps on these sections and the existing station piping arrangement allows for the re-routing of gas during the shut in.
100,1203,"Because of this, no CNG or LNG support will be required."
100,1204,Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP299snchoonHighlightForecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,1205,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,1206,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.

100,1278,"Installation of a new vaulted flow meter on an existing pipeline equipped with power and telemetry (FM) Then, using historical and estimated VEP costs for each identified work breakdown category, SoCalGas compiled costs for each project type by pipeline diameter."
100,1279,SoCalGas then reviewed typical minimum and maximum costs to validate the averages.
100,1280,"Similarly, material cost estimates were prepared based on recent purchase orders and release costs."
100,1281,Construction Management (Company and Inspector) and Union Labor costs were estimated based on typical project durations and detailed activity check lists.
100,1282,"Other elements included in the estimates are Environmental, Engineering, Survey, Company/Contractor Project Management Labor and Land."
100,1283,"These elements were assigned percentage values, as a proportion of the total direct construction cost, based on typical averages for similar projects."

100,1364,The hydrotest section Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP342splits are based on test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.
100,1365,"The lowest and highest elevations are 3,050 feet and 4,158 feet, respectively."
100,1366,The entire 8.115-mile section of pipeline will be isolated to accommodate the timely completion of all hydrostatic testing activities.
100,1367,"The capital work of this project includes the replacement of two valves to enable future piggability, and nine short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure."
100,1368,This capital work totals to 592 feet.
100,1369,Alternatives Considered Line 225 is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system.
100,1370,"Abandoning this line would create a substantial loss in capacity since L-225 is a critical pipeline to receive Rocky Mountain supplies and support customers in southern California, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley."
100,1371,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1372,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,1373,Shut-In-Analysis Line 225 can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest from October 1st to November 15th and April 1st to May 31st.
100,1374,"These timeframes are contingent upon full receiving capacity being available at the Southern and Northern zones, no limitations or restrictions on storage withdrawal, Wheeler Ridge being available to support the San Joaquin Valley, and Honor Rancho being available to support the Los Angels Basin."
100,1375,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,1376,There are two taps in total that will need to be isolated from L-225 prior to the shutdown.
100,1377,Both taps will require CNG support during the shut-in.
100,1378,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,1379,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,1380,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,1381,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,1382,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,1383,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.
100,1384,"As described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 59 working days."

100,1400,Project Description The Line 1030 project will hydrostatically test 25.788 miles of pipe.
100,1401,"L-1030 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed predominatly in 1955."
100,1402,This portion of pipeline has an MAOP between 695 and psig.
100,1403,"The project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at the end of Line 2001 East near Desert Center, CA, continuing west to where Line 2001 West begins dear Cottonwood Springs Rd. The project consists of 25.434 miles of Phase 2A pipe, 0.340 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.014 miles of incidental pipe."
100,1404,The incidental pipe has been included to facilitate constructability by minimizing the test breaks and welds.
100,1405,This project is divided into 14 individual test sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.
100,1406,"The lowest and highest elevations are 820 feet and 1,750 feet, respectively."
100,1407,"The capital work of this project includes the replacement of four taps, three anomaly repairs and 16 short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP354procedure."
100,1408,This capital work totals to 930 feet.
100,1409,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L-2001 East and L-2001 West, L-1030 is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,1410,The abandonment of this section of L-1030 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,1411,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1412,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option."
100,1413,Shut-In Analysis The line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.
100,1414,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,1415,"During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which is bridled to L-1030, there is no need for CNG support during this project."
100,1416,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,1417,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."

100,1449,Project Description The Line 2001 West project will hydrostatically test 5.658 miles of pipe.
100,1450,"L-2001 West is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed predominatly in 1953."
100,1451,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,1452,L-2001 West was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 64.1 miles.
100,1453,"To execute the project, Line 2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-2001W-B, L-2001W-C, L-2001W-D, L-2001W-E and L-2001W."
100,1454,"The L-2001 West project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning east of Chiriaco Summit, CA, continuing west to the Cactus City Station."
100,1455,The entire length of this project consists of Phase 2A pipe.
100,1456,The project is divided into 3 individual test sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.
100,1457,"The lowest and highest elevations are 1,355 feet and 1,520 feet, respectively."
100,1458,The capital work of this project includes the replacement of four short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.
100,1459,This capital work totals to 190 Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP366feet.
100,1460,"Alternatives Considered In conjuction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,1461,The abandonment of this section of L-2001 West would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,1462,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1463,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,1464,Shut-In Analysis The line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.
100,1465,The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.
100,1466,"During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which is bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project."
100,1467,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,1468,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,1469,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.
100,1470,"As defined in testimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure."
100,1471,"This work breakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked."
100,1472,Estimated durations were established for each task to derive a total project timeline.
100,1473,"As described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 57 working days."

100,1496,Project Description The Line 2001 East project will hydrostatically test 27.433 miles of pipe.
100,1497,"L-2001 East is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed predominatly in 1954."
100,1498,This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,1499,"The L-2001 East project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning outside of Mesa Verde, CA, continuing west ending a few miles east of Desert Center, CA."
100,1500,"The project consists of 27.278 miles of Phase 2A pipe, 0.151 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.004 miles of incidental pipe."
100,1501,The incidental pipe has been included to facilitate construction by minimizing the test-breaks and welds.
100,1502,The project is divided into 11 individual test sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.
100,1503,"The lowest and highest elevations are 355 feet and 825 feet, respectively."
100,1504,The capital work of this project includes the replacement of one tap and 12 short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.
100,1505,This capital work Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP378totals to 665 feet.
100,1506,"Alternatives Considered In conjuction with L-2001 West and L-1030, L-2001 East is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,1507,The abandonment of this section of L-2001 East would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,1508,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option ."
100,1509,Shut-In Analysis The line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.
100,1510,"During the outage, customers served by regulator stations within the isolated section will be supplied by L-2000 which is bridled to L-2001 at those locations."
100,1511,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,1512,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."
100,1513,Schedule The schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.

100,1535,Project Description The Line 2005 project will hydrostatically test 0.280 miles of pipe.
100,1536,L-2005 is a high pressure transmission pipeline that was installed in 1950.
100,1537,The pipeline has an MAOP of psig.
100,1538,"The L-2005 project takes place in Riverside County, CA, beginning in the Moreno Small Station and continuing south to the Moreno Large Station."
100,1539,The entire length of this project consists of Phase 2A pipe.
100,1540,The project is to be tested in one segment due to negligible elevation changes over the length of the hydrotest.
100,1541,"The lowest and highest elevations are 1,557 feet and 1,580 feet, respectively."
100,1542,The capital work of this project includes the replacement of two short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.
100,1543,This capital work totals to 72 feet.
100,1544,Southern California Gas Company 2019 GRC APP390Alternatives Considered Line 2005 is the primary tie-over from L-2001 West to L-2000 to feed gas from the SoCalGas transmission system to San Diego.
100,1545,The abandonment of L-2005 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the San Diego Transmission Zone since gas moves from Blythe towards San Diego via this route.
100,1546,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1547,Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option.
100,1548,Shut-In Analysis The line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.
100,1549,There are no customers within the hydrotest segment that must be considered before an outage could be implemented.
100,1550,"However, L-2005 is a tie-over pipeline from L-2001 West to L-2000, duringthe outage, customers served by the L-2005 tie-over will be supplied solely by L-2000."
100,1551,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
100,1552,"The TIC estimate includes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land acquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction."

100,1573,Project Description The Line 2001 East Blythe Compressor Station will install 385 feet of pipe.
100,1574,"L‐2001 East is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1954."
100,1575,This portion of the pipeline has a MAOP of psig.
100,1576,"The project is located in Riverside County, CA, all work is being performed within the Blythe Compressor Station."
100,1577,The entirety of the project consists of Phase 2A pipe.
100,1578,The project is entirely within the SoCalGas facility and the pipe will be installed via open trench.
100,1579,"Alternatives Considered In conjunction with L‐2001 West and L‐1030, L‐2001E is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA."
100,1580,The abandonment of this section of L‐2001W would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.
100,1581,"Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option."
100,1582,"Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option."
100,1583,Shut‐In Analysis The line section can be taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.
100,1584,There are no customer taps on these sections and the existing station piping arrangement allows for the re‐routing of gas during the shut in.
100,1585,"Because of this, no CNG or LNG support will be required."
100,1586,Forecast Methodology SoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.
