INTRODUCTION \n\nThe project workpapers that follow provide detailed information regarding the forecasted cost for each \nof the ten Phase 1B and twelve Phase 2A projects included in this Application.  As stated in SCG-15 the \nmethodology used to develop these forecasted costs include components that follow the guiding \nprinciples of Stages One (Project Initiation) through Three (Begin Detailed Planning) for the Seven Stage \nReview process, which was established to promote efficient project execution.  \n\nEach workpaper is organized as follows to capture the key elements of the estimate: \n\nCost and Project Summary \u2013 provides an overview of the project scope and costs. \n\nAlternatives Considered \u2013 for Phase 1B replacement projects, describes the options to replacement (de-\nrating, abandonment). \n\nForecast Methodology \u2013 describes the basis of the cost estimated and the categories of costs \nconsidered in developing all project estimates. \n\nSchedule \u2013 describes the basis for the schedule used across all project estimates. \n\nProject Satellite and Topographic Map \u2013 two maps are provided (when applicable): a conventional map \nto provide the reader with general location of the project, and a satellite map that shows the type of \nterrain (urban, rural, river crossings, highways, etc.) the project traverses. \n\nMileage Table \u2013 the mileage for the project broken down by phase and accelerated and incidental miles, \nas defined in the testimony of Ronn Gonzalez in Chapter II. \n\nMaterial Costs - estimate based on the type and quantities of material required for each project. \n\nConstruction Costs \u2013 based upon input from construction contractors, assumptions made in the \ndevelopment of the construction component of the project, which generally account for approximately \n50% of total project cost.  General assumptions include a geographically based construction cost \nestimate, estimated construction schedule duration, working days and hours taking into consideration \nany working hour restrictions, type of pipe installation method for replacement projects, and other \npertinent construction assumptions.  Additional detailed construction information, including site \nmobilization/facilities, site management, material handling, traffic control, substructure location, post-\nconstruction pressure test, final pipeline tie-in, abandonment of existing pipeline, paving, site \nrestoration, site demobilization, and construction field overhead assumptions. \n\nEnvironmental Costs - based upon evaluation of the project by PSEP Environmental Services, \nassumptions and associated costs regarding anticipated permitting, surveys, and monitoring, \nhazardous/non-hazardous waste containment/disposal, Permit fees, and mitigation fees.  Identified \nenvironmental issues unique to the project are also listed. \n\nLand/Right of Way Costs \u2013 assumptions include need for new easements, construction yards for the \nstorage of material and construction trailers and associated permits and legal services. \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n3\n\n\n\nCompany Labor Costs \u2013 anticipated activity and level of effort for SoCalGas management and \nrepresented personnel in support of the project. \n\nOther Costs \u2013 estimated costs of contracted Project Management and Engineering services. \n\nIncluded in each of the above key elements are the assumptions used to form the basis of estimate. \n\nThere is contains a Glossary that will assist in defining specific terminology used throughout the \nworkpapers.  \n\nThe Summary Table of Projects provides a summary of relevant data for each project included in this \nApplication (Line Number, Phase, project type (replacement, pressure test, abandonment, de-rate), line \ntype (Transmission, Distribution), costs (loaded O&M costs, loaded capital costs and total loaded costs), \nmileage, and diameter. \n\n \n\nPSEP Seven Stage Review Process1 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs explained in testimony, the Seven Stage Review Process sequences and schedules PSEP project \nworkflow deliverables.2  The Seven Stage Review Process consists of seven stages with specific \nobjectives for each stage and an evaluation gate at the end of each stage to verify that objectives have \nbeen met before proceeding to the next stage.3 \n\nBelow is a description of the common activities that occur within each stage: \n\nStage 1 (Project Initiation) is where the Phase 1 WOA is initiated. The Phase 1 WOA is used to track \ncosts for the early stage investigation and validation of Category 4 Criteria mileage and to fund \nenough preliminary project scoping and design to develop an initial cost estimate (Phase 2 WOA). \nThe Project Initiation Stage is where mileage originally included for remediation may be decreased \ndue to scope validation efforts, reduction in Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (MAOP), or \nabandonment of lines that are no longer required from a gas operating system perspective. \n \nStage 2 (Test or Replace Analysis) is where SoCalGas and SDG&E analyze data for selection of testing or \nreplacement and focus on achieving PSEP\u2019s four objectives. Project execution options are presented \nand considered prior to proceeding to the next stage. \n \n\n1 Stages 1-3 have been completed for the projects included in this application \n \n2 The Seven Stage Review Process was implemented by the PSEP Organization beginning in the Second Quarter of \n2013.  \n\n \n\n3 Certain stages are condensed or combined for valve and small pipeline projects. \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n4\n\n\n\nStage 3 (Begin Detailed Planning) is where a project execution plan is finalized, baseline schedules are \ndeveloped, funding estimates are developed, and project funding is obtained. The preliminary design \nestimates or Total Installed Costs (TIC) are estimated in direct dollars. Based on the TIC direct \nestimate, a Phase 2 WOA which adds in the indirects is populated. At the end of Stage 3 a preliminary \ndesign of the project is complete. \n \nStage 4 (Detailed Design/Procurement) is where design and construction documents are completed, \nnecessary permits and authorizations are attained, a construction contractor is selected, and pipeline \nmaterials are purchased, received, and prepared for turnover to contractors. \n \nStage 5 (Construction) is where construction contractors are mobilized and monitored to (1) \ndocument progress and compliance; (2) conduct testing; and (3) maintain project scope quality, \nbudget, and schedule. \n \nStage 6 (Place into Service) is where commissioning and operating activities are performed to achieve \ncompletion certification for the project. \n \nStage 7 (Closeout) is where regulatory, contractual, archival activities are performed to close the \nproject in an orderly manner and issue acceptance certificates.  \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n5\n\n\n\nWP-SCS-1-16 \n\nStandard Construction Summary for  \n\nReplacement, Hydrotest, and Valve Enhancement Plan Projects  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n6\n\n\n\nStandard Construction Summary for Replacement, Hydrotest \n \nThe following information provides an overview of the typical construction activities that occur during \nSoCalGas and PSEP pipeline replacement and hydrotest projects. \n \nIt should be noted that there are some projects that may differ from the general activities described \nbelow, as project activities depend on the unique characteristics of each particular project. \n \nThis first section describes the typical activities of a replacement project. The following section will \ndiscuss the differences seen in a hydrotest project as compared to a replacement project. \n \n\nReplacement Project \n \n\n1. Permits \u2013 Typically Stages 3 or 4 \nOne of the initial construction activities that affect project decisions is the securing of permits. PSEP \nprojects are in a variety of locations: congested urban areas, highways/freeways, railroads/light rails, \nbridges, environmentally and culturally sensitive areas, coastal zone, commercial centers, private land, \nhillsides, airport zones, etc., and, as such, there are usually many permits required for a project. Each \narea will present unique requirements that are necessary for successful and safe construction which also \nmust follow the specific requirements, such as requiring night work (see Figure 4), as stated in each of \nthe specific permits pulled for a project. Permits may take many months to secure and the requirements \nof the permit may not be known until construction is about to begin. The permits may be local, state, or \nfederal permits and clearances and they address all natural resources \u2014 land, air, water, vegetation, and \nwildlife \u2014 as well as the interests of the general public such as noise. Some of the most common \nagencies involved are local municipalities, Caltrans, local tribal organizations, U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, Bureau of Land Management, environmental agencies, etc. \n \n2. Surveying and Locating \u2013 Stages 3 or 4 \nSurveying and locating activities will typically take place during Stages 3-4 and determine the right of \nway (ROW) and pipeline location. The ROW is a narrow strip of land (public or private property) that \ncontains the pipeline(s) and is where all onsite construction activities occur. Before any construction \nactivities can begin, survey and locate & mark crews carefully survey and mark out the construction right \nof way for the existing pipeline and other substructure locations. \n \nSince it is critical that the exact pipeline location and substructures are known prior to the start of \nconstruction, potholing is also typically completed during Stage 4, but there are times when this activity \ncannot start until Stage 5 (construction). Potholing involves excavating a small hole over the pipeline to \nvalidate the location of an existing substructure. \n \nSurveying and locating activities help to determine what will be needed for the temporary construction \neasements, possible substructure conflicts within the desired replacement location, and other issues \nthat will need to be accounted for in the project design. \n \nIn Stage 4, the land acquisition team is evaluating nearby locations for a lay-down yard and field \nconstruction office which will stage the equipment, material, fabrication space, water for hydrotests, \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n7\n\n\n\nwork trailer, etc. for several weeks. Ideally, the yard will be at least 50,000 square feet or about the size \nof a football field (See Figure 5). \n \nLastly, during Stages 3 and 4, affected customers are identified and communication materials are \ngenerated and sent out which notify customers of the upcoming construction activities in the area. This \nnotification takes place earlier enough in the process so as to allow for customer input and changes to \nconstruction as needed. \n \n3. Clearing and Grading Construction and Lay-down Yard - beginning Stage 5 \nAt the beginning of Stage 5 (Construction) the clearing/grading activities typically take place for projects \nin the non-paved locations.  A few require extensive work due to work being located on hillsides.  \nClearing is the removal of all brush from the construction work area. Grading is required to provide a \nrelatively level surface to allow safe operation of the heavy equipment. It should be noted before any \nconstruction activity takes place an environmental inspection may be required of the laydown yard and \nthe pipeline construction area. \n \n4. Trenching and Excavating \u2013 Stage 5 \nTrenching and excavating activity takes place in Stage 5 (Construction). The trenching operation in \npavement begins with a saw-cutting crew which cuts the pavement for excavation. Once the pavement \nis removed from the area, the trenching can begin.  The trenching crew typically uses a backhoe to dig \nthe replacement pipe trench. The trench is excavated to a depth that provides sufficient cover over the \npipeline after backfilling.  Typically, the trench is about 4 to 6 feet wide in stable soils and at least 5-feet \ndeep (depends on the pipeline\u2019s diameter and DOT Class location to actual depth). This depth allows for \nthe required minimum 36 inches of cover. \n \nMany pipelines are located at a depth which requires elaborate shoring systems to be installed for \nconstruction. The shoring is necessary when the excavation is more than 5 feet deep or is in sandy soil \nconditions (see Figure 6). The shoring can limit the work area due to beams and other structures that \nobstruct the construction process which slows down production (see Figure 1). An example of why \ngreater pipeline depth is needed is a railroad crossing or storm drain conflict. \n \nGiven the work that needs to take place on the existing pipeline, the excavation may require, per code, \nhand-digging over the gas pipeline to expose the pipe and other potential utility substructures in the \narea. The hand- digging process can be labor and time intensive. For example, if the trench that the \npipeline must be installed within is running laterally with another utility structure and the distance is \nunder the legal threshold for mechanical excavation, the entire length must be hand excavated. \n \nThere are also many requirements that have to be met during the excavation process that are governed \nby the various permits issued for a project. For example, when excavating in traveled roadways, steel \nplates will be needed to cover the open trench at the end of each day. The process of moving the plates \non the trench and welding them together at the end of the day and then removing them each morning \ntakes additional time that may decrease productivity depending on the available working hours set by \nthe permitting agency. \n \n \nSome installations require a bore operation when the pipeline needs to go under a structure and an \nopen trench cannot be dug, for example for crossing a freeway/highway, or railroad, or to avoid \ndisrupting traffic across a busy intersection. In this case, there is only an excavation at the start and end \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n8\n\n\n\nof the bore route; however, these bore pits are typically 30 feet x 15 feet and at a minimum depth of 20 \nfeet (oftentimes greater). This activity requires extensive bell-hole preparation and is a complicated \nprocess that necessitates a specialized crew and equipment (see Figures 7 and 8). \n \nOften, each replaced pipeline has taps that feed an individual customer or a regulator station which \nneed to be connected to the new pipeline once put into service.  Each tap location requires an \nexcavation which is on average approximately 5 feet x 8 feet and takes a crew approximately 1 day per \nhole to excavate depending on the soil conditions (shoring may also be needed). Those excavations will \nbe plated and left open until the new pipeline section is tested and gassed up.  Then these tap \nconnections can be completed and backfilled. \n \nLastly, there are some municipalities that require the existing pipeline to be removed and the new \npipeline to be installed in the same location. This also might be necessary if the pipeline right of way is \nnot large enough for the replacement pipeline. This removal step can greatly add to the complexity and \ntime for the project. \n \n5. Pipeline Laying, Bending, Welding - Stage 5 \nThe pipe sections, fittings and other pipeline components are laid out on the job site for installation as \nconstruction proceeds. In order to follow the correct route the pipe\u2019s direction is changed by either \nbends or welding in segmented ells (see Figure 9). In some cases the joints are welded together and \nplaced on temporary supports. The pipe crew and a welding crew are responsible for the welding \nprocess. The pipe crew typically uses special pipeline equipment called side booms to pick up each joint \nof pipe, align it with another joint, and make the first part of the weld (a pass called the stringer bead). \nAdditional filler passes are made by welders who immediately follow the stringer bead. There could be \ndifferent welders for the different welds needed: stringer, hot-pass, and capping welders make up the \ntypical welding crew, and they are often followed by tie-in welders. \n \n6. Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) - Stage 5 \nAs part of the quality assurance process, each welder must pass qualification tests (Operator \nQualification) to work on a particular pipeline job, and each weld procedure must be approved for use \non that job in accordance with federally adopted welding standards. \n \nThe welds undergo visual and radiographic inspection (a.k.a., X-ray), as outlined in 49 CFR Part 192 by \nqualified technicians and inspectors. The technicians take X-rays of the pipe welds to ensure that the \ncompleted welds meet federally prescribed quality standards. The X-ray technician processes the film in \na small, portable darkroom at the site. If the technician detects any unacceptable flaws, the weld is \nrepaired or cut out, and a new weld is made as per code requirements. \n \n7. Lowering Pipe into the Trench - Stage 5 \nDepending on the length of pipe to replace, lowering the welded pipe into the trench demands close \ncoordination and skilled operators (see Figure 9). Using a series of side booms (tractor designed to move \npipelines into place), operators simultaneously lift and carefully lower the welded pipe sections into the \ntrench. The bottom of the trench is shaded with at least 6 inches of sand to protect the pipe and coating \nfrom damage. Lastly, cathodic protection test stations may be installed on the pipeline before \nbackfilling. \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n9\n\n\n\n8. Field Coating - Stage 5 \nPipelines are externally coated to prevent moisture from coming into direct contact with the steel and \ncausing corrosion. Typically, coated pipelines are delivered with uncoated areas three to six inches from \neach end to prevent the coating from interfering with the welding process. Once the welds are \ncompleted, a coating crew coats the remaining portion of the pipeline. Prior to this coating application, \nthe coating crew thoroughly cleans the bare pipe with a power wire brush or a sandblast machine to \nremove any dirt, mill scale, or debris. The crew then applies the coating and allows it to dry. Once dry, \nthe coating of the pipeline is inspected to ensure it is free of defects: it is electronically inspected, or \n\u201cjeeped,\u201d for faults or voids in the epoxy coating and visually inspected for faults, scratches, or other \ncoating defects. \n \n9. Backfilling and Paving - Stage 5 \nAfter all welds have passed NDE, coating is completed and passes inspection, and survey crews record \nthe location of the pipe and various valves/fittings, crews begin the backfilling process. As with previous \nconstruction crews, the backfilling crew takes care to protect the pipeline and coating by using a \nminimum of 12 inches of zero-sack slurry (sand and water mixture) on top of the top pipe. Then the \nremainder of the backfill material is placed over the pipe. The final step is paving. \n \n10. Hydrostatic Testing - Stage 5 \nDepending on the varying elevation of the terrain along the pipeline and the location of available water \nsources, the pipeline may be divided into sections to facilitate the test. Each section is filled with water \nand pressured up to DOT requirements and held for a specified period of time to determine if the \npipeline meets the design strength requirements and if any leaks are present (see Figures 10 and 11 for \nhydrotest set ups). Once a section successfully passes the hydrostatic test, water is emptied from the \npipeline and the pipeline is dried to ensure that no water is present when natural gas begins to flow. \n \nThe drying out of the pipeline is completed using large compressors and foam tools (pigs). A pig launcher \nand receiver are installed at the ends to facilitate this process. The team will continue to pass the pig \nthrough the system until the desired dew point is reached as prescribed by engineering.  Once achieved, \nthe final tie-ins and commissioning activities can commence. This drying process usually takes 3 days, \nmore or less depending on the length and geometry of the pipeline. \n \nThe used water is tested by environmental services for disposal purposes. Containers such as Baker \nTanks are used to store the water before disposal while water testing results are being evaluated (see \nFigures 10, 11, and 12). Filtration equipment is used to remove organic and inorganic material to permit \ndisposal levels. The water may be disposed of at a sewer, transported to a disposal facility via a truck or \nprovided to a third party for non- potable reuse. How the water is disposed often times depends on \npermit requirements. \n \n11. Final Tie-in and commissioning - Stage 5 and 6 \nFollowing successful hydrostatic testing and drying process, the final pipeline tie-ins are made and \ninspected (see Figure 13). The line is then odorized which is a process that will take up to 2 days or more \nto complete. After odorization is achieved, the tie-in process is completed with flow being opened to all \ntaps. Any customers who were being fed by CNG/LNG have their service switched to being fed from the \nnew pipeline. \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n10\n\n\n\nThe process for the abandonment of the original line also needs to take place. It begins by purging, \nisolating the ends and taps, and permanently decommissioning the line which could take a few days to \ncomplete. \n \n12. Cleanup and Restoration - Stage 5 and 6 \nThe final step in the construction process is to restore the street, right-of-way, easement land and lay-\ndown yard as closely as possible to its original condition. This step involves cleaning up the lay-down \nyard, completing the paving repairs or land restoration as required by the issued permit or land owner. \nCareful attention is paid to ensure future erosion issues are addressed for non-paving involved \ninstallations. \n \nThis next section describes the hydrotest project activities as they differ from a pipeline replacement \nproject.  \n \nHydrotest Project \na. The trenching/excavating activity for a hydrotest project will involve exposing the pipeline to be \n\ntested as follows: \nb. Identified pipeline features will be removed. The removal process in general will also involve \n\nwelding and NDE (see Figure 14). \nc. All non-piggable pipeline features will be removed. \nd. All pipeline features that cannot be pressure tested will be replaced/removed. \ne. All tap locations (customer lines, regulator station taps, etc.) that are off the main line will be \n\nexcavated because they need to be isolated before a hydrotest. \nf. Each end of the project will be exposed to install test heads. This will require a minimum of a 10 foot \n\nx 20 foot bell hole. \n \nThere is a small amount of replacement work during a hydrotest project that is necessary to isolate the \npipe and install the test heads. This replacement activity requires the following: \n\na. The small section of pipe is removed at each end. \nb. The non-tested line must be welded with a cap that will be cut out after testing is completed. \nc. The test heads are welded into place and NDE follows. \nd. The pipe is hydrotested. \ne. The test heads are cut out and the pig launcher/receiver is installed. The drying process takes \n\nplace after water is removed \nf. The pig launcher/receiver is removed and a new tested section of pipe is installed. All taps and \n\nmain line ties are completed using the welding process. \n \nLastly, since the pipeline is being taken out of service, there could be CNG/LCG activities: deliveries, \ninstallation, management and eventually removal required for the individual customers fed off the \npipeline being tested (see Figure 15). \n \nSee the following link for a video describing the process.   \n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRFWeTRAcCU \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n11\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRFWeTRAcCU\n\n\nThe following section describes the PSEP valve enhancement project activities (retrofits or new valve \ninstallations/stations) as they differ from a pipeline replacement project. \n\nPSEP Valve Enhancement Project \n \n\na) Some work will occur on SoCalGas and SDGE property which will not always necessitate obtaining a permit. \nThe permits that are obtained may be for assets underground, aboveground or both. The valve work may \ninvolve obtaining new ROW or easements agreements for installations in new locations. The aboveground \nwork could be extensive with the commissioning of buildings and other structures to house communications, \ndata panels, etc.  (see Figure 17) \n\nb) For the valve enhancement projects submitted in this application, they are located in both city streets and in \nthe rural areas. The urban valve locations typically require additional assembly space which is frequently larger \nthan the given ROW rights; and therefore, land acquisition activity presents a greater challenge as compared to \npipeline work in the streets (see Figure 18). \n\nc) The survey and locating activities will include potholing to confirm the depth and alignment of the pipe/valve \nassembly. Also, the distances of the valve/pipe from sidewalks or other areas will be determined. This \ninformation is critical to the vault and actuator designs because of the varying heights and horizontal space \nrequirements for the equipment. At times, these activities may determine whether a pipeline needs to be \nrelocated to accommodate a valve installation/retrofit. Lastly, depending on the type of project installation, \nland may need to be purchased in order to accommodate facilities such as a large valve station that will include \nsmall buildings, communication installations, and other structures. \n\nd) Each valve enhancement project involves significant excavation work that differs from hydrotests or \nreplacement projects. Below is a list of possible excavations that may take place on a valve enhancement \nproject: \n\u2022 Expose the existing valve assembly (all sides) and for the installation of a new vault. \n\u2022 Install a new valve location and associated vault. \n\u2022 Remove pipeline features as required. \n\u2022 Bring in new power/communications lines. \n\u2022 Install gas control gas piping for sensing functions. \n\u2022 Prepare the foundation for retaining wall installations for cabinets or to secure the entire facility. \n\u2022 Install line break cabinets, SCADA buildings, and antennae poles. \n\u2022 Install looped grounding systems in the valve station. \n\ne) Hydrotesting will occur on any new valve assemblies. For some projects the test will take place aboveground in \nthe lay-down yard and for other projects it will occur with the main-line pipe which will involve test heads and pig-\nlauncher/receiver assemblies. \n\n \n\n         This concludes the overview of the general construction activities that take place with PSEP replacement,     \nhydrotest and valve enhancement projects. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n12\n\n\n\nNote: the following photos were taken on PSEP jobs performed by SoCalGas \n \n\nFigure 1: Trenching in Urban Location \n \n\n \n \n \n\nFigure 2: Lowering Pipe in Congested City Area \n \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n13\n\n[image: image1.jpg]  \n\n[image: image2.jpg]  \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Installing Pipe in Trench with Existing Substructures \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4: Night Work Construction Site \n \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n14\n\n[image: image3.jpg]  \n\n[image: image4.jpg]  \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Construction Laydown Yard \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6: Shoring \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n15\n\n[image: image5.jpg]  \n\n[image: image6.jpg] TRENCH SHOP \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 7: Jack and Bore Pit \n\n \n \n\nFigure 8: Jack and Bore Operation \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n16\n\n[image: image7.jpg]  \n\n[image: image8.jpg]  \n\n\n\nFigure 9: Lowering Section of Pipe into Trench \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n17\n\n[image: image9.jpg]  \n\n\n\nFigure 10: Hydrotest Equipment \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Hydrotest Set Up with Sound Proofing to Minimize Noise Complaints \n(located behind Baker tank) \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n18\n\n[image: image10.jpg] FOR \n\n[image: image11.jpg] R A B 800-7 \n\n\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Baker Tanks \n\n \n \n\nFigure 13: L-2000 Tie-In Construction \n\n \n\n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n19\n\n[image: image12.jpg]  \n\n[image: image13.jpg]  \n\n\n\nFigure 14: Feature to be Removed from L-2000W Before Hydrotest \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15: CNG for Temporary Bypass \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n20\n\n[image: image14.jpg]  \n\n[image: image15.jpg] BETHANE COMPECHES \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 16: Above-Ground Pre-Fabrication of Valve Assembly \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n21\n\n[image: image16.jpg] CAT \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 17: Above-Ground Valve Equipment \n\n                                                  \n\n \n\nFigure 18: Large Valve Station with Numerous Above-Ground Features                            \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n22\n\n[image: image17.jpg]  \n\n[image: image18.jpg] J+ 8A \n\n\n\nWP-G-1-4 \n\nGlossary  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n23\n\n\n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS \nThe following list of acronyms, terms and high level definitions are intended to accompany the \nworkpapers that support the SoCalGas 2019 General Rate Case Application and specifically testimony \nSCG-15.

L-235 West Section 1 is a \nhigh pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1957. This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of \n\n psig. \n \nThe project is located in San Bernardino, CA, beginning at the Newberry Station, continuing west towards the City \nof Victorville, CA, ending on the west side of Barstow Road.  The project consists of 24.356 miles of Phase 2A pipe \nand 0.281 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing the \nexcavations, test breaks, and tie-in work.  \n \nThis project is divided into 47 individual test sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.  \nThe lowest and highest elevations are 1,916 feet and 4,527 feet, respectively.  The capital scope of work includes \nthe replacement of 48 short sections of pipe and remediation of 16 identified anomalies to facilitate the \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n30\n\n\n\nhydrotesting procedure.  This capital work totals to 2,656 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-235, L-235 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system.  Abandoning this line \nwould create a substantial loss in capacity to the Northern Transmission Zone since gas moves from the receiving \npoints North and South of Needles, CA towards the Adelanto, CA via L-235 and L-235 West.  The gas supply from \nAdelanto supports the entire SoCalGas Transmission System, which serves the Los Angeles Basin Loop from one or \nmore of the City Gates.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than \n20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nLine 235 West Section 1 can be temporarily taken out of service for pressure testing, so long as L-335 remains fully \nin service between Quigley, CA and Adelanto, and no other outages are in effect for the duration of the hydrotest.  \nThe line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  There are six taps that will require isolation from L-\n235 West prior to the shutdown.  One of the taps is a regulator station bridled to Line 1004 in Newberry Station, \nthree of the taps are not in service or abandoned, and the last two taps are for cathodic protection rectifiers. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 152 working days. \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n31\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for L-235 West Section 1 \n \n\n \n \n\n \nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n\n \nPHASE MILEAGE \n\nPHASE 2A 24.356 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0 \nINCIDENTAL 0.281 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 24.637 \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n32\n\n[image: image19.jpg] Daggett Yermo Re Minneola Rd Valley Center Rd Valley Center Rd National Trails Hwy Marine Corps Daggett Barstow-Daggett Airport Base Barstow National Trails Hwy Newberry Rd Newberry Springs National Trails Hwy 40 235 WEST Section 1 Legend ........

L-235 West \nSection 2 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1957.  This portion of the pipeline \nhas an MAOP of psig. \n \nThe project is located in San Bernardino, CA, beginning on the east side of Sawtooth Canyon, continuing west \nending on the east side of the Mojave River span.  The project consists of 18.865 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 1.483 \nmiles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, \ntest breaks, and tie-in work. \n \nThis project is divided into 27 hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.  The \nlowest and highest elevations are 2,681 feet and 4,039 feet, respectively.  The capital scope of work includes the \nreplacement of 28 short sections of pipe and four anomalies to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.  This capital \nwork totals to 1,496 feet. \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n48\n\n\n\nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-235, L-235 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system.  Abandoning this line \nwould create a substantial loss in capacity to the Northern Transmission Zone since gas moves from the receiving \npoints North and South of Needles, CA towards the Adelanto, CA via L-235 and L-235 West.  The gas supply from \nAdelanto supports the entire SoCalGas Transmission System, which serves the Los Angeles Basin Loop from one or \nmore of the City Gates.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than \n20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nLine 235 West Section 1 can be temporarily taken out of service for pressure testing, so long as L-335 remains fully \nin service between Quigley, CA and Adelanto, and no other outages are in effect for the duration of the hydrotest.  \nThe line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  There are five taps that will require isolation from \nL-235 West prior to the shutdown.  One of the taps is not in service or abandoned, two taps are for cathodic \nprotection rectifiers, the remaining two taps will require Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) support. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 120 working days. \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n49\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for L- 235 West Section 2 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 18.865 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0 \nINCIDENTAL 1.483 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 20.348 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n50\n\n[image: image28.jpg] Helendale Test Break 8 Test Break 9 Test Break 19 Test Break 20, Test Break 18 Test Break 17 Test Break 16 Test Break 14 Test Break 10 Test Break 11 Test Break 21 Test Break 12 Test Break 13 X Test Break 21 Test Break 22 Test Break 23 XXxx 235 WEST Section 2 Test Break 24 Stoddard Walls Johnson Ra Dale Evans PKwy Quarry Rd Test Break 25 de Test Break 26 Test Break 27 Navajo Rd Test Break 28 Apple Valley Airport Waslew Rd Legend Corwin Rd ........

L-235 West Section 3 is a \nhigh pressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1957.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of \n\npsig. \n \nThe project is located in San Bernardino, CA, beginning in Adelanto, CA, continuing west ending at the Littlerock \nStation.  The project consists of 26.537 miles of Phase 2A pipe, 0.086 of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.261 miles \nof incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, test \nbreaks, and tie-in work. \n \nThis project is divided into six hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.  The \nlowest and highest elevations are 2,762 feet and 3,092 feet, respectively.  The capital scope of work includes pipe \nthat will be replaced at the end of test break 6 to avoid installing a test head inside Littlerock Station and the \nreplacement of six short sections of pipe (totaling 132 feet) to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.  This capital \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n64\n\n\n\nwork totals to 223 feet.   \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-235, L-235 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system.  Abandoning this line \nwould create a substantial loss in capacity to the Northern Transmission Zone since gas moves from the receiving \npoints North and South of Needles, CA towards the Adelanto, CA via L-235 and L-235 West.  The gas supply from \nAdelanto supports the entire SoCalGas Transmission System, which serves the Los Angeles Basin Loop from one or \nmore of the City Gates.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than \n20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nLine 235 West Section 3 can be temporarily taken out of service for pressure testing, so long as Line 335 (L-335) \nremains fully in service between Quigley, CA and Adelanto and no other outages are in effect for the duration of \nthe hydrotest.  The line will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  There are 19 taps and one crossover \nthat will need to be isolated from L-235 West prior to the shutdown.  Five of the taps are not in service or \nabandoned, three are bridled with L-335 and will require isolation from L-235 West, and the remaining eleven taps \nare unbridled and will require Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).  One of the taps that require CNG support is a \nRegulator Station that supplies a Pressure District with a single feed line that serves multiple industrial customers. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 76 working days. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n65\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for L-235 West Section 3 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 26.537 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.086 \nINCIDENTAL 0.261 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 26.884 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n66\n\n[image: image35.jpg] 140 th StE E Avenue G Shadow Mountain 200th St E E-Avenue Saddelbeck E Avenue K Butte State Park 150th StE 240th StE Los Angeles San Bernardino El Mirage OHV Recreation Area 145th St E Avenue O Imd Blud 170thS/E El Mirage Rd Lon liew Rd Test Break 6 Test Break 5 Test Break 4 Ad 235 WEST Test Break 7 Section 3 Test Break 3 Test Break 2 LolTest Break-1- 106th St E E Avenue T Pearblossom -165th StE 18 warblossom Hwy 138 Fort Tejon Rd Llano Sheep Creek Rd Largo Vista Rd Antelope Hwy Legend Fort Tejon Rd .......

L-407 is a high pressure transmission \npipeline, this portion was installed in 1951.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig. \n \nThe L-407 project is located in Los Angeles County, CA, beginning in Tarzana, CA, continuing south ending in \nSullivan Canyon in Los Angeles, CA.  The project consists of 3.959 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.013 miles of \nincidental pipe.  The incidental was included improve safety by moving one of the tie-in locations away from a main \nstreet do a more isolated location and constructability by relocating another tie-in point to a location that would \nprovide adequate space for the construction team. \n \nThis project is divided into two individual test sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation \nchanges.  The lowest and highest elevations are 600 feet and 1,890 feet, respectively.  The capital scope on this \nproject includes replacement of three short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.  This capital \nwork totals to 69 feet. \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n78\n\n\n\nAlternatives Considered \nLine 407 plays a critical role in meeting the operational needs of the SoCalGas transmission system transporting gas \nfrom the northern portion of the Los Angeles Basin to the southern portion.  The abandonment of this section \nwould result in a loss in capacity.  Because of this, abandonment is not an option.  Derating to less than 20% SMYS \nwould reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet system demand and also is not an option \n \nShut-In Analysis \nLine 407 can be temporarily taken out of service during the summer months as long as L-3003 remains in service.  \nThere are no customers within the hydrotest segment therefore no CNG support will be required. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                                    \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 46 working days.  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n79\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for L-407 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 3.959 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0 \nINCIDENTAL 0.013 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 3.972 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n80\n\n[image: image40.jpg] nd Dr Divido Dr Ber VMission-pump Ra Mission Canyon LA.

L-1011 is a high pressure transmission \npipeline, this portions was installed in 1947.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig. \n \nThe Line 1011 is located in Ventura County, CA, beginning near the intersection of Ventura Avenue and Rocklite \nRoad in Ventura, CA, continuing across the Ventura Mountains and ending on Hall Canyon Road. The project \nconsists of 1.495 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.278 miles of incidental pipe. The incidental included to improve \nconstructability by minimizing the excavations, test-breaks, and tie-in work. \n \nThe project is divided into two individual test sections to address the existence of an above ground span.  Testing \nthrough the span would require additional pipe supports and modifications to the bends at the beginning and end \nof the pipeline span.  The span can be removed from scope because it was installed in 1995 and there are valid test \nrecords from that project.  The capital scope of this project includes the replacement of the four short sections of \npipe and 11 un-piggable bends to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure and future in-line inspections.  This capital \nwork totals to 1,468 feet. \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n89\n\n\n\nAlternatives Considered \nLine 1011 is critical for the Transmission system operational needs.  Abandoning this line would create a substantial \nloss in capacity as it is the primary feed for two regulator stations and abandonment would impact the supply to \nboth core and non-core customers.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to \nless than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand \nand also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nLine 1011 can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest as long as L-404 remains in service.  The \nline will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  There are no customers within the hydrotest segment, \nthere is no need for CNG support during this project. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                             \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 52 working days. \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n90\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for L-1011 \n \n\n \n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 1.495 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.000 \nINCIDENTAL 0.278 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 1.773 \n\n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n91\n\n[image: image43.jpg] ware Dr Canada De San Joaquin Texaco Access Rd Contura Hupast enecast Katari St Aztec Ave Chinook O 1011 XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX 1011 Kalorama Legend ..

L-2000 is a high pressure \ntransmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1947.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of psig.  The \nL-2000 project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 117.6 miles.  To more efficiently \nexecute this large project, L-2000 was divided into the following projects: L-2000-A, L-2000-Bridge, L-2000-C, L-\n2000 Chino Hills, L-2000-D, L-2000-E, L-2000 East of Cactus City, and L-2000-West. \n \nThe project is located in Orange County, CA, and Riverside County, CA, beginning just west of the Prado Dam, \ncontinuing west through the Chino Hills State Park towards the City of Brea, CA.  The project consists of 9.982 miles \nof Phase 2A pipe and 0.016 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe is included to improve constructability by \nminimizing the excavations, test-breaks and tie-in work. \n \nThe project is divided into 34 individual  sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.  The lowest and \nhighest elevations are 560 feet and 1,650 feet, respectively.  The capital work of this project includes the \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n100\n\n\n\nreplacement of 37 short sections of pipe, six taps, and remediation of four anomalies to facilitate the hydrotesting \nprocedure.  This capital work totals to 2,105 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nLine 2000 is a backbone line that plays a critical role in meeting the operational needs of the SoCalGas transmission \nsystem between Blythe and Spence Street Station.  The abandonment of this section of L-2000 would result in a \nsubstantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the \nLos Angeles Basin.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% \nSMYS would reduce the the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer .  There are \nseveral customers within the hydrotest segment that must be considered before an outage could be implemented.  \nPrior to shutting in the line, the customers within the isolated section will be connected and supplied with (CNG) \nduring the outage. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                                 \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 141 working days. \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n101\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for L-2000 Chino Hills \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 9.982 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.000 \nINCIDENTAL 0.016 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 9.998 \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n102\n\n[image: image46.jpg] Prado Rd Eucl Kimball Ave Los Sorianos 142 Country 83 Firestone Club Boy Scout Reservation Vellana country El Frado Club Golf Course Butterfield Ranch Rd Prado Regional Park L-2000 Carbon Canyon Rd Chino Hillsin Gold Clubs 71 ranchury Rd Yorba Linda Blud Village Center Dr San Bernardino& Lakeview Ave Kellogg Dr paren'tde las Palos Palma Ave Esperanza Ro Green River La Palma Ave Featherly Golf Club Legend San to A Regional Park andcome Accelerated Phase 2B XXXXX Incidental Abandon za Canyon Ro Fairmont Blud Replace Test E Canyon Rim Rd Anaheim Pipeline 0 0.5 m Golf Course 2 Sources Esri, HERE, DeLorme, USGS, Intermap, INCREMENT P, NRCan, Esri Japan, METI, Esri China Miles (Hong Kong), Esri Korea, Esri (Thailand), MapmyIndia, NGCC, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS wer User Community \n\n\n\nProject Map showing location of Test Breaks for L-2000 Chino Hills (Test Break 1 \u2013 20) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n103\n\n[image: image47.jpg] RiverS Test Break 20 Test Break 19 Test Break 18 Test Break 17 Test Break 16 Sing Creek Test Break 15 Test Break 14 Test Break 13 Corona Expy Test Break 12 Test Break 11 Test Break 10 Test Break 9 Test Break 8 Test Break 7 Test Break 6 Test Break 5 Test Break 4 Legend Test Break 3 prona EXP .....

L-2000 is a high pressure transmission \npipeline, this portion was installed in 1947.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. The L-2000 \nproject was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 117.6 miles. To more efficiently execute \nthis large project, L-2000 was divided into the following projects: L-2000-A, L-2000-Bridge, L-2000-C, L-2000 Chino \nHills, L-2000-D, L-2000-E, L-2000 Blythe to Cactus City, and L-2000-West. \n \nThe project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at the Cactus City Compressor Station, continuing west \ntowards Indio.  The project consists of 8.756 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.128 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe.  \nThe Phase 2B pipe was included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work.  \n \nThis project is divided into five hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.  \nThe lowest and highest elevations are 1,000 feet and 1,700 feet, respectively.  The capital scope of work includes \nthe replacement of pipe under the I-10 freeway utilizing a slick and bore and the replacement of six short sections \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n115\n\n\n\nof pipe to facilitate the hydrotest procedure.  The segment under the I-10 freeway is being replaced to mitigate the \nrisk associated with a pipeline failure due to a pipeline anomaly.  This capital work totals to 640 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nLine 2000 is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The \nabandonment of this section of L-2000 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern \nTransmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin Because of this, abandonment is \nnot a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, \nresulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.  The \nline will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  During the outage, customers served by regulator \nstations within the isolated section will be supplied by L-2001 which is bridled to L-2000 at those locations. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                             \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven-stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 104 working days. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n116\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for Line 2000-E Desert Hydrotest \n \n\n \n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 8.756  \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B  0.128  \nINCIDENTAL 0.000 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 8.884 \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n117\n\n[image: image52.jpg] Joshua Tree National Park 10 2000-E Section 1-5 10 Legend ....

L-2000 is a high \npressure transmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1947.  This portion of L-2000 an MAOP between 695 \nand psig.  The L-2000 project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 117.6 miles.  \nTo more efficiently execute this large project, L-2000 was divided into the following projects: L-2000-A, L-2000-\nBridge, L-2000-C, L-2000 Chino Hills, L-2000-D, L-2000-E, L-2000 Blythe to Cactus City, and L-2000 West. \n \nThe project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning west of Mesa Verde, CA near Ironwood State Prison, \ncontinuing west ending at the Cactus City Station Compressor Station.  The project consists of 64.026 miles of \nPhase 2A mileage, 0.564 miles of accelerated Phase 2B mileage, and 0.060 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental \npipe is included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work.  \n \nThis project is divided into 32 individual test sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.  The lowest \nand highest elevations are 380 feet and 1,760 feet, respectively.  The capital scope of work includes the \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n127\n\n\n\nreplacement of 33 short sections of pipe, 14 taps, and remediation of two identified anomalies to facilitate the \nhydrotesting procedure.  This capital work totals to 1,905 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nLine 2000 is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The \nabandonment of this section of L-2000 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern \nTransmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin Because of this, abandonment is \nnot a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, \nresulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.  The \nline will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  During the outage, customers served by regulator \nstations within the isolated section will be supplied by L-2001 which is bridled to L-2000 at those locations. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                             \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 127 working days. \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n128\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for L-2000 Blythe to Cactus City \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 64.026 \nACCELERATED PHASE 2B 0.564 \nINCIDENTAL 0.060 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 64.650 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n129\n\n[image: image55.jpg] 02 Joshua Tree National Park 177 L-2000 East of Cactus City COX Legend ....

L-2000 West is a high pressure \ntransmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1953.  The pipeline has a MAOP of psig.  The L-2001W \nproject was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 64.1 miles. To more efficiently execute \nthis large project, L-2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-2001W-B, L-2001W-C, L-\n2001W-D, and L-2001W-E. \n \nThis project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning west of Indio, CA, continuing west ending at the \nWhitewater Station.  The project consists of 13.830 miles of Phase 2A pipe and .023 miles of incidental pipe.  The \nincidental pipe has been included to facilitate constructability by minimizing excavations, test breaks, and tie-in \nwork. \nThis project is divided into 13 hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes and \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n144\n\n\n\nenvironmental impact mitigation.  The lowest and highest elevations are 120 feet and 1,090 feet, respectively.  The \ncapital scope of work includes the replacement of four taps and 16 short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotest \nprocedure.  Additionally, 237 feet of pipe will be replaced east of Whitewater station following the Decision Tree \nmethodology for segments of pipe under 1,000 feet.  This capital work totals to 877 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system \nbetween Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The abandonment of this section of L-2001W would result in a \nsubstantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the \nLos Angeles Basin.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% \nSMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not \nan option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.  The line will \nbe isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which \nis bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                             \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 141 working days. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n145\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for Line 2001W-C Desert Hydrotest \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \nPHASE MILEAGE \n\nPHASE 2A 13.830 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0 \nINCIDENTAL 0.023 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 13.853 \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n146\n\n[image: image64.jpg] N-Indian Canyon Dr Desert Hot Twentynine Palms-Hwy Springs Hacienda Ave 2001W-C Section 21 Palm Dr Mountain View Rd Dillon Rd Palm Canyo 2001W-C Test Section Indio Hills Palms Park 16-20 n Rd Vista Chino Coach 2001W-C DOF Ra Pre Test Section Palm 13-14 Springs Thousa Ramon Rd Palms E Ramon Ro Diah Shore Dr Cathedral Date Palm Dr Gerald Ford or City Rancho Bob Hope D Mirage Monterey Ave Cook St Country Club Dr Bermuda Portola A HOWey LIE Dunes Avenue 42 2001W-C Test Indian Fred Waring Dr Section 1-6 Palm wells Desert 111 Jeffer soria Indio 10 Avenue 48 Legend Coachella Avenue 52 Monroe St 50th Ave La Quinta ..

This portion of the pipeline has a MAOP of \n\npsig.  The L-2001W project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 64.1 miles.  To \nmore efficiently execute this large project, Line 2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-\n2001W-B, L-2001W-C, L-2001W-D, and L-2001W-E. \n \nThe project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at the at Whitewater Station, continuing west to the \nMoreno Small Station.  The consists of 16.341 miles of Phase 2A pipe, 0.825 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, \nand 0.677 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe has been included to improve constructability by minimizing \nexcavations, test breaks, and tie-in work. \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n156\n\n\n\nThis project is divided into 16 hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations, pipeline accessibility issues, \nand environmental impact mitigation.  The lowest and highest elevations are 1,070 feet and 2,370 feet, \nrespectively.  The capital scope of work includes the replacement of one tap, 21 short sections of pipe, and two \nanomalies to facilitate the hydrotest procedure.  The capital work totals to 840 feet.   \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system \nbetween Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The abandonment of this section of L-2001W would result in a \nsubstantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the \nLos Angeles Basin.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% \nSMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not \nan option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.  The line will \nbe isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which \nis bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                             \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 126 working days. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n157\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for Line 2001W-D Desert Hydrotest \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \nPHASE MILEAGE \n\nPHASE 2A 16.341 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.825 \nINCIDENTAL 0.677 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 17.843 \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n158\n\n[image: image67.jpg] pt Rd Forest Falls 38 Mill Creek-Ra Mentone Ave Ave 5th Ave Yucaipa Bryant St 5th S Wildwood State Park Pak Canyon Rd Calimesa Wildwood Canyon RD River side Oak gren leo Canyon Ra Morongo Test Test Reservation 2001W-D Test Section Beau hont Ave Section Section 2001W-D 6 16-22 14 11 Test 2001W-D en tynine p w with XI Section 4-9 Beaumont E-6th S.t W.Ramsey Set Banning Testr Cabazon 10 Section 1 111 Os Rd 243 N Palm Ca Budge St idyllwild Panoramic Santa Rosa San Jacinto Mountains Ramona Expy National Monument Legend Soboba Rd Mount San ....

L-2001 West is a high pressure \ntransmission pipeline, this portion was installed in 1953.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig.  The \nL-2001W project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 64.1 miles. To more efficiently \nexecute this large project, L-2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-2001W-B, L-2001W-\nC, L-2001W-D, and L-2001W-E \n \nThe project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at Cactus City Compressor Station, continuing west \ntowards Indio.  The project consists of 8.828 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.052 accelerated miles of Phase 2B pipe \nwhich are located within the Phase 2A sections. \n \nThis project is divided into five hydrotest sections to address test pressure limitations due to elevation changes and \nenvironmental impact mitigation.  The lowest and highest elevations are 1,020 feet and 1,880 feet, respectively.  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n168\n\n\n\nThe capital work includes the replacement of six short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotest procedure.  The \ncapital work totals to 240 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system \nbetween Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The abandonment of this section of L-2001W would result in a \nsubstantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the \nLos Angeles Basin.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% \nSMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not \nan option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.  The line will \nbe isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which \nis bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                             \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 73 working days. \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n169\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for Line 2001W-E Desert Hydrotest \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \n\nPHASE 2A 8.828 \n\nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.052 \n\nINCIDENTAL 0.000 \n\nTOTAL MILEAGE 8.880 \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n170\n\n[image: image70.jpg] Joshua Tree National Park 10 2001W-E Section 1-5 10 Legend ....

These \nactivities are beyond those which are recorded to the Phase 2 Memorandum Account, which was established to \nrecord preliminary planning and engineering design costs to develop individual project cost estimates.  With the \ntime and advance preparation required to obtain permits taking up to 36 months, waiting until Commission \napproval of the next GRC to commence this activity would result in projects not being completed in a timely \nmanner.  In order to complete these projects as soon as practicable, more detailed engineering design is required \nto develop the necessary documents for permitting, environmental permitting and land acquisition activities.  \nPermitting agencies require detailed design when assessing what permits will be required. Environmental \npermitting requirements are based on design refinement produced later in the design process. Land acquisition \nalso requires further design refinements to detail the land rights needed to complete a project.  The forecasted \namount presented here represents costs for seven projects anticipated to be included in the 2022 GRC that may be \nsubject to a lengthy permitting process. \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n183\n\n\n\nImplementation Continuity Costs \nProjects O&M Capital Total \n225 North $ 439,875 $ 267,794 $ 707,669 \n1030 $ 1,284,058 $ 606,152 $ 1,890,210 \n5000 $ 0 $ 20,178 $ 20,178 \n2005 $ 191,956 $ 86,915 $ 278,871 \n2001E \u2013 Hydro $ 1,191,755 $ 568,069 $ 1,759,824 \n2001E - Replace $ 0 $ 18,630 $ 18,630 \n2001 West $ 633,696 $ 289,688 $ 923,384 \nTotal design costs $ 3,741,340 $ 1,857,426 $ 5,598,766 \n\n \nThe Pre-Engineering Costs to obtain a Stage 3 Estimate are projected to be incurred prior to the Test Year and are \nnot reflected in the requested revenue requirement.

L-85 is a high pressure transmission pipeline, this \nportion was installed in 1931.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe project is located in Kern County, CA, beginning west of Elk Hills Road and continuing southeast to Lake \nStation.  The replacement consists of 9.358 Phase 1B miles, 0.014 miles of Phase 2A, and 3.658 miles of incidental \npipe.  Of the incidental pipe, 1.004 miles is included to improve constructability by minimizing excavations, and tie-\nin work.  The remaining 2.654 miles of incidental pipe is due to re-routes related to a new alignment.  This route \nminimizes impact to property owners and established farmlands along the existing route. \n \nThe majority of the pipe will be installed via open trench.  Approximately 2,400 feet will be installed via Horizontal \nDirectional Drilling (HDD) across the California Aqueduct. The use of conventional bore technique will be utilitized \nto cross existing draingaes along the proposed alignment. Approximately 900 feet of the new pipeline will be \ninstalled via conventional bore to avoid impacts to jurisdictional drainages. One casing bore is proposed for the \nnew pipeline to cross State Highway 119, approximately 93 feet long. \n \nBelow is additional scope included within the installation of the new L-85: \n\u2022 New receiver assembly for in-line inspection \n\u2022 A new MLV and bridle assembly will be located at Valley West Road and Airport Road on the east side of \n\nAirport Road \n\u2022 The existing regulator station located at Valley West Road and Elk Hills Road will be abandoned and a new \n\nregulator station will be installed at the new MLV site  \n\u2022 A new 6\u201d lateral pipeline, approximately 1 mile in length, will be installed at the new MLV site to connect to \n\nexisting L-103 \n\u2022 A new MLV and bridle assemply located west of Gerald Street will be tied into existing L-7053 \n\u2022 A new regulator station will be installed at the intersection of Gerald Street and Isaac Road to replace existing \n\nstation \n\u2022 L-8110 will be tied over to the new L-85 pipeline \n\u2022 A new MLV and bridle assembly at Lake Station Road will replace the existing valve \n\u2022 The bridle assembly will tie over to existing SL-38-283 and approximately 1,200 feet of  pipe will be installed \n\non Lake Station Road to connect to existing L-7049 \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n191\n\n\n\n\u2022 New MLV and bridle assembly at Lake Station to connect to existing L-203 \n\u2022 A new launcher assembly will be installed for In-Line Inspection \n \nAlternatives Considered \nThis section of L-85 is the sole source of supply to numerous core and large non-core customers, as well as the \nprimary source of supply for multiple distribution and transmission systems including the San Joaquin Valley and \nCoastal areas.  Abandoning this line would prevent these customers from being serviced.  Because of this, \nabandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the \nsystem resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nLine 85 will not be taken out of service during the install.  Pressure Control Fittings (PCF\u2019s) will be utilized for the tie \nin of L-85 and all additional tie-ins will be complete and the new line will be active before the existing line is taken \nout of service.  There is no need for CNG support with this project.   \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 187 working days. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n192\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for Line 85 \n \n\n  \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \nPHASE MILEAGE \n\nPHASE 1B 9.358 \nPHASE 2A 0.014 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 1.004 \nINCIDENTAL/RE-ROUTE  2.654 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 13.030 \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n193\n\n[image: image73.jpg] course Golf Course Rd Creek 119 Elk Hour Rd Broad Gre 85 NORTH 19 port p Legend Re-route .assoon Phase 2A XXXXX Incidental Abandon Gardner Field Roy Replace Test Pipeline 0 0.25 0.5 1 Sources: Esri, HERE, Delorme, USGS, Intermap, INCREMENT P, NRCan, Esri Japan, METI, Esri China Miles (Hong Kong), Esri Korea, Esri (Thailand), MapmyIndia, NGCC, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS User Community \n\n\n\nSatellite Map for Line 85 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n194\n\n[image: image74.jpg] Course Golf Course Rd 119 last Rid 85 NORTH Airport Rd LECedar St Legend Re-route Abandon Gardner Feld Ry Replace Test 0 0.25 0.5 Pipeline Miles Esri, HERE, DeLorme, MapmyIndia, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, Esri, HERE, DeLorme, MapmyIndia, OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS user community, Source: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus DS, USDA, USGS, AeroGRID, IGN, and the GIS User Community \n\n\n\nThe direct cost for each area are summarized below. \n \nMaterial \n\nProject Costs Prior to 2018 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total \n\nDIRECT LABOR $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nDIRECT NON-LABOR $0  $0  $1,285,717  $10,550,699  $4,675,747  $16,512,163  \nTOTAL DIRECT COSTS $0  $0  $1,285,717  $10,550,699  $4,675,747  $16,512,163  \n \nAssumptions \nMaterials for this project will not be purchased until final internal authorization is obtained.

SL-36-9-09 North is a \nhigh-pressure pipeline, this portion was installed in 1920. This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe project is located in San Luis Obispo County, CA, west of the city of Santa Margarita, CA, west of Highway 101, \ncontinuing southeast parallel to Highway 101 ending just southeast of the intersection of Highway 58 and \nHighway 101.  The replacement consists of 0.686 miles of Phase 1B pipe, 0.192 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.026 \nmiles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe has been included to improve constructability by providing a better \ntie-in point and easing site accessibility.  \n \nThe project takes place in a rural area, 0.438 miles of pipe will be installed using the open trench method.  \nApproximately 2,305 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).  The use of HDD is required to \ncross underneath the Santa Margarita Creek as well as the surrounding trees and rugged terrain.  The utilization \nof HDD resulted in the a more direct route which shortened the alignment by 0.029 miles. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSupply Line 36-9-09 North Section 12 is a critical line within the coastal distribution system and is the major \nsupply line for customers in the area.  Abandoning this line would result in an inability to meet needs of \ncustomers in the Central Coast.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating this section of SL-\n36-9-09 North to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet \ncustomer demand during peak seasons and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSupply Line 36-9-09 North Section 12 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer \nconditions.  The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF).

SL-36-9-09 North is a high \npressure pipeline, this portion was installed in 1920. This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe project is located in San Luis Obispo County, CA in the city of Santa Margarita, CA.  The replacement consists of \n1.755 miles of Phase 1B pipe, 0.001 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.059 miles of incidental pipe.  Of the incidental \npipe, 0.027 miles is included to facilitate construction.  The remaining 0.132 miles of incidental pipe is due to a re-\nroute that follows an existing access road to minimize the impact to environmentally sensitive areas. The proposed \nre-route also allows for safer monitoring and maintenance of the pipeline compared to the existing route.  \n \nThe project is in a rural area and 1.765 miles of the pipe will be installed using the open trench method.  \nApproximately 615 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).  The use of HDD is required to \ncross underneath a stream, trees, and rugged terrain.  Approximately 175 feet will be installed via slick bore under \na railroad crossing. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSupply Line 36-9-09 North Section 14 is a critical line within the coastal distribution system and is the major supply \nline for customers in the area.  Abandoning this line would result in an inability to meet needs of customers in the \nCentral Coast.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating this section of SL-36-9-09 North to \nless than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand \nduring peak seasons and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSupply Line 36-9-09 North Section 14 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer \nconditions.  The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF).  There one customer located within \nthis replacement.  CNG support will be required. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement and construction. \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n211\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.

SL-36-9-09 North is a high-\npressure pipeline, this portion was installed in 1920. This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe project is located in San Luis Obispo County, CA.  The replacement consists of 1.075 miles of Phase 1B pipe, \n0.032 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.424 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe is due to a re-\nroute.  The re-route is necessary due to the existing route being congested with other utilities and there is no room \nto add a new pipeline. The re-route will follow an existing, paved county road to minimize impact to \nenvironmentally sensitive areas.  The proposed re-route also allows safer monitoring and maintenance of the \npipeline when compared to the existing route.   \n \nThe project is in a rural area and 1.465 miles of pipe will be installed using the open trench method. Approximately \n350 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).  The use of HDD is required to cross the San Luis \nObispo Creek at the south end of the replacement. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSupply Line 36-9-09 North Section 15 is a critical line within the coastal distribution system and is the major supply \nline for customers in the area.  Abandoning this line would result in an inability to meet needs of customers in the \nCentral Coast.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating this section of SL-36-9-09 North to \nless than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand \nduring peak seasons and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSupply Line 36-9-09 North Section 15 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer \nconditions.  The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF).  There is one customer that will be \nsupplied with CNG during the tie-in. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement and construction. \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n221\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked. Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 95 working days. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n222\n\n\n\nProject Map for SL-36-9-09N Section 15 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 1B 1.075 \nPHASE 2A 0 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.032 \nINCIDENTAL- RE-ROUTE 0.424 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 1.531 \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n223\n\n[image: image79.jpg] Cuesta Guest Cue Cues 36-9-09 NORTH Section 15 El Camino Real Thy 101 Legend - Re-route El Camino Real co.

Of the incidental pipe, 0.011 miles was included \nto improve constructability by minimizing the excavations, test breaks, and tie-in work.  The remaining 0.621 miles \nof incidental pipe is due to a re-route that follows an existing access road so as to minimize the impact to \nenvironmentally sensitive areas.  The proposed re-route also allows for safer monitoring and maintenance of the \npipeline compared to the existing route. \n \nApproval to remediate the Phase 1A pipe was delayed due to access issues to the pipeline, which is on private land.   \n \nThe project is in a rural area and 1.913 miles that will be installed using the open trench method.  Approximately \n517 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).  The use of HDD is necessary due to the pipeline \nalignment going downhill.  Approximately 32 feet will be installed via slick bore.  This is required to cross \nunderneath a stream. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nAbandonment of SL-36-9-09 North Section 16 is not a viable option as it is a critical line within the coastal \ndistribution system and is the major supply line for customers in the area.

SL-36-1032 Section \n11 is a high-pressure pipeline, this portion was installed in 1939 and 1940.  This portion of the pipeline has an \nMAOP of  psig. \n \nThe project is located in Santa Barbara County, CA south of Orcutt, CA.  The project consists of 0.411 miles of Phase \n1B pipe and 0.083 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe was due to a re-route along Highway 135 to meet \nCaltrans requirements. \n \nThe project is located in a rural area and the majority of the installation will be done via open trench.  \nApproximately 482 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).  The use of HDD is required to \ncross Highway 135.  Two jack-and-bores will also be utilized.  One of approximately 90 feet and one of \napproximately 60 feet, both are to install the line across two creeks.  Two existing valves will be replaced with new \nball valves.  \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSupply Line 36-1032 Section 11 is a critical line with Santa Barbara County and is a major supply line for customers \nin the area.  Abandoning this section would create a substantial loss in capacity and would result in an inability to \nmeet the needs of customers in Santa Barbara County during the winter months as the system relies on the \ncombined north and south feeds of SL-36-1032.  Additionally, SL-36-1032 is the sole feed to SL-36-9-04 which \nserves a critical customer.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than \n20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option.   \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSL-36-1032 Section 11 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions.  The \npipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF\u2019s).  There are no customer taps along the proposed \nreplacement therefore no CNG support will be required for this project.  Customers downstream from this section \ncan be temporarily back fed by the existing network. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n241\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.

SL-36-1032 Section \n12 is a high pressure, this portion was installed in 1943 and 1946.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  \npsig. \n \nThe project is located in Santa Barbara County, CA south of Orcutt, CA.  The project consists of 2.256 miles of Phase \n1B pipe and 2.951 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe was due to a reroute done to avoid installation \nwithin agricultural property.  An additional reroute shortened the alignment by 0.048 miles. \n \nThe project is located in a rural area and the majority of the installation will be done via open trench.  \nApproximately 4,445 feet will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).  There will be three separate \nHDD\u2019s performed, one of approximately 845 feet to cross Highway 135, and two to cross various creek and \nculverts, these are approximately 2,000 feet and 1,600 feet in length.  The jack and bores will also be utilized \ntotaling approximately 346 feet.  These are to cross some additional creeks and culverts and are 41 feet, 197 feet \nand 108 feet in length.  An existing valve will be replaced with a new ball valve. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSupply Line 36-1032 Section 12 is a critical line with Santa Barbara County and is a major supply line for customers \nin the area.  Abandoning this section would create a substantial loss in capacity and would result in an inability to \nmeet the needs of customers in Santa Barbara County during the winter months as the system relies on the \ncombined north and south feeds of SL-36-1032.  Additionally, SL-36-1032 is the sole feed to SL-36-9-04 which \nserves a critical customer.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than \n20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option.   \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSL-36-1032 Section 12 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions.  The \npipeline will be tied-in using an existing Pressure Control Fitting (PCF) on the north end of the hydrotest that was \ninstalled during the SL-36-1032 Section 11 test, and by using a new PCF that will be installed on south end of this \ntest.  There are eight customer taps within the proposed replacement.  These customers will be supported by CNG \nduring the tie-in.  Downstream customers can be back fed by the existing pipe network. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n251\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.

This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe project is located in Santa Barbara County, CA, southwest of the intersection of Harris Grade Rd. and Highway \n135 continuing south along Harris Grade Rd. through the Lompoc Valley (Purisima Hills).  The replacement consists \nof 2.761 miles of Phase 1B mileage, 0.161 miles of Phase 2A mileage, and 0.288 miles of incidental pipe.  Of the \nincidental pipe, 0.253 miles are for re-routes to the existing alignment to avoid hillsides where erosion has been \nexperienced and further erosion is expected.  The remaining 0.035 miles of incidental pipe has been included to \nimprove constructability by minimizing the excavations, and tie-in work. \n \nThe project is located in a rural area and the replacement pipe will all be installed via open cut trenching.  Within \nthe section, there is a 0.174 mile span that crosses the San Antonio Creek which is not part of the replacement but \nwill remain in place to be utilized during the testing process to allow for a continuous test.   \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSupply Line 36-1032 Section 13 is a critical line with Santa Barbara County and is a major supply line for customers \nin the area.

Derating the pipeline to less than \n20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSL-36-1032 Section 13 can be temporarily taken out of service during most of the year except during peak winter \nmonths.  The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF\u2019s).  There are several core and non-core \ncustomers both within the replacement segment and downstream of the replacement segment that will be \nimpacted by an outage.  Prior to shutting in the line, the customers within the replacement section will be \nconnected and supplied with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).  The remaining downstream customers will continue \nto be fed by the existing pipe network however, SoCalGas will need to coordinate timing of the temporary shut-in \nwith a critical customer due to the lowered capacity when either the north or south feed is undergoing an outage. \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n261\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.

SL-36-1032 Section 14 is a high \npressure pipeline, this portion was installed in 1928.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig.   \n \nThe project is located in Santa Barbara County, CA, starting in the Lompoc Valley, continuing south adjacent to \nHarris Grade Rd.  The replacement consists of 1.498 miles of Phase 1B mileage, 0.147 miles of Phase 2A mileage, \nand 0.085 miles of incidental pipe.  Of the incidental pipe, 0.050 miles are for re-routes included in the project area \nto avoid or minimize disturbances to the natural vegetation of the ecological reserve, and a re-route onto Harris \nGrade Rd. on the northern end of the replacement done in order to avoid an environmentally sensitive area.  The \nremaining 0.035 miles of incidental pipe is due to a relocation of the tie-in point on the south end of the \nreplacement and to include a short section between two Phase 1B segments included to improve constructability \nby minimizing the excavations, and tie-in work. \n \nThe entire length of the replacement will be installed via open trench. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSupply Line 36-1032 Section 14 is a critical line with Santa Barbara County and is a major supply line for customers \nin the area.  Abandoning this section would create a substantial loss in capacity and would result in an inability to \nmeet the needs of customers in Santa Barbara County during the winter months as the system relies on the \ncombined north and south feeds of SL-36-1032.  Additionally, SL-36-1032 is the sole feed to SL-36-9-04 which \nserves a critical customer.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than \n20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSL-36-1032 Section 14 can be temporarily taken out of service during most of the year except during peak winter \nmonths.  The pipeline will be tied-in using Pressure Control Fittings (PCF\u2019s).  There are several core and non-core \ncustomers both within the replacement segment and upstream of the replacement segment that will be impacted \nby an outage.  Prior to shutting in the line, the customers within the replacement section will be connected and \nsupplied with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).  The remaining upstream customers will continue to be fed by the \nexisting pipe network however, SoCalGas will need to coordinate timing of the temporary shut-in with a critical \ncustomer due to the lowered capacity when either the north or south feed is undergoing an outage. \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n272\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 90 working days. \n \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n273\n\n\n\nProject Map for SL-36-1032 Section 14 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 1B 1.498 \nPHASE 2A 0.147 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.000 \nINCIDENTAL 0.035 \nINCIDENTAL \u2013 RE-ROUTE 0.050 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 1.730 \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n274\n\n[image: image89.jpg] 36-1032 Section 14 d Cir St Andrews Way pinehurst Dr con Crest OF Legend Re-route 8.soso.

SL-44-1008 is a high pressure pipeline, \nthis portion was installed in 1937.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig.  \n \nThe original pipe diameter is  and the replacement pipe diameter will be upsized to  in order to meet \nthe increased system demand and to improve reliability.  The total estimated direct cost of this project is \n$87,828,484, $11,246,653 of which is due to the upsizing of the pipeline to .  The region will fund the cost \nof the upsizing, PSEP will fund the remaining $76,581,831.  Any additional costs related to the upsizing of the \npipeline will also be funded by the region.  PSEP will fund any additional costs not related to the increase in the \ndiameter of the pipeline.  \n \nThe project is located in Kings County, CA, Kern County, CA and San Luis Obispo County, CA, beginning south of the \nCity of Avenal, CA in Kings County continues southwest ending in the City of Atascadero, CA.  It will generally follow \na 25-foot offset from the existing pipeline.  The replacement consists of 49.849 miles of Phase 1B pipe, 0.118 miles \nof accelerated Phase 2B pipe and 4.892 miles of incidental pipe.  Of the incidental pipe 3.556 miles is due to re-\nroutes to minimize impact to property owners and established farmland along the existing route.  The remaining \n1.336 miles are located within the project boundaries and are due to various relocations over the years.  Including \nthese sections of incidental mileage improves constructability by minimizing the excavations, and tie-in work. \n \nThe project is primarily in rural areas and the majority of the pipe will be installed via open trench.  Approximately \n2.5 miles will be installed via Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD).  The use of HDD over these 2.5 miles are for \nvarious crossings, there are a total of 27 separate instances where HDD with be utilized.  Additionally, \napproximately 1,200 feet will be installed using a slick bore method.  The slick bore method is being utilized to \navoid open trenching in environmentally sensitive areas and in Caltrans\u2019 right of way.  There are nine planned slick \nbores. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nSL-44-1008 is the primary feed for the area and is critical in supporting customers in the region.  Abandoning this \nline would create a substantial loss in capacity to the Kings, Kern and San Luis Obispo Counties and would result in \nan inability to meet the needs of customers in the area.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  \n\n1SoCalGas\u2019 showing includes 50% of the estimated project costs. If the Commission grants SoCalGas\u2019 request for a fourth year to the GRC cycle, the entire estimated projects \ncosts for 44-1008 would be included as the entire project is anticipated to be placed into service in 2022. This supplemental workpaper details the cost of the entire project \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n284\n\n\n\nTherefore, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the \ncapacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nSL-44-1008 can be temporarily taken out of service during both winter and summer conditions with summer \nconditions being preferred.  There is one regulator station that supplies approximately 12,000 customers and 14 \ncustomer taps within the segment.  Prior to shutting in the line, these 14 customers and the regulator station will \nbe connected and supplied with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) during the tie-in, they will then be tied into the \nnew line.  \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 225 working days. \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n285\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for SL-44-1008 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \nPHASE MILEAGE \n\nPHASE 1B 49.849 \nPHASE 2A 0 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.118 \nINCIDENTAL 1.336 \nINCIDENTAL \u2013 RE-ROUTE 3.556 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 54.859 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n286\n\n[image: image91.jpg] Hare Canyon Bradley Bradley Ry Indian Valley Rd Camp Peberts Estella Ra 7101 Alport RO Jardine Rd 46 Quent UES UOP HeyS S River Ra Springs Rd Creston Rd mpleton El Pomar Or Camp BRd yara or Lupino L Legend Creston Accelerated ...

Additionally, 510 feet of blow-off piping, crossover piping, and bridle piping \nassociated with this L-2000 and L-2001-W crossover that is within the Cactus City Compressor Station will be \nreplaced.  This project was originally proposed in A.11-11-002 as one project consisting of 117.6 miles.  To more \nefficiently execute this large project, L-2000 was divided into the following projects: L-2000-A, L-2000-Bridge, L-\n2000-C, L-2000 Chino Hills, L-2000-D, L-2000-E, L-2000-E Cactus City Station, L-2000 East of Cactus City, and L-2000-\nWest. \n  \nThis project is located in Riverside County, CA inside of the Cactus City Compressor Station.  The replacement \nconsists of 821 feet of Phase 2A pipe and 62 feet of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe has been included to \nincrease safety during construction and to minimize tie-in work. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001W and L-2000 are primary feeds to the SoCalGas transmission \nsystem between Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The abandonment of this section of L-2001W and /or L-2000 \nwould result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from \nBlythe towards the Los Angeles Basin.  Additionally, the Cactus City Compressor Station consists of main line block \nvalves, cross-over piping, blow-off piping, and bridle piping, that provide the necessary operational flexibility to the \nSoCalGas transmission system.  Finally, the block valves and blow off piping satisfy the necessary main line valve \nspacing and pipeline blow-down requirements as per CPUC safety guidelines.  Because of this, abandonment is not \na viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in \nan inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThis portion of L-2000 and L-2001 West can be temporarily taken out of service.  There are no customer taps on \nthese sections and the existing station piping arrangement allows for the re-routing of gas during the shut in.  \nBecause of this, no CNG or LNG support will be required.  \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n299\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 43 working days. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n300\n\n\n\nProject Map for Cactus City Station \n \n\n \n \n\n PROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \nPHASE MILEAGE \n\nPHASE 2A 0.156 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.000 \nINCIDENTAL 0.011 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 0.167 \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n301\n\n[image: image97.png] 2001W 2000 Legend moomoo Accelerated Phase 2B xXXXX Incidental Abandon Replace Test Pipeline 0 25 50 100 Sources: Esri, HERE, Delorme, USGS, Intermap, INCREMENT P, NRCan, Esri Japan, METI, Esri China Feet (Hong Kong), Esri Korea, Esri (Thailand), MapmyIndia, NGCC, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS User Community \n\n\n\nSatellite Map for Cactus City Station \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n302\n\n[image: image98.jpg] 2001W 2000 Legend Hydrotest Replace 25 50 100 Pipeline Feet Esri, HERE, DeLorme, Mapmyindia, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, Esn, HERE, DeLorme, Mapmyindia, @ Open StreetMap contributors, and the GIS user community, Source: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoBye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus DS.

Installation of control power, and telemetry equipment (C/P) \n2. Installation of a new aboveground actuator on an existing valve equipped with control, power and \n\ntelemetry (A/AG) \n3. Installation of a new vaulted actuator on an existing valve equipped with control, power and telemetry \n\n(A/VT) \n4. Installation of a new underground valve with a vaulted actuator equipped with control, power and \n\ntelemetry (NV/AG) \n5. Installation of a new underground valve with a vaulted actuator equipped with control, power, \n\nand telemetry (NV/VT) \n6. Installation of new solar power equipment and radio telemetry to enhance an existing automated \n\nvalve (COMM) \n7. Installation of new control piping to an existing regulator station to prevent backflow (BFP1) \n8. Installation of a new underground check valve on an existing pipeline to prevent backflow (BFP2) \n9. Installation of a new vaulted flow meter on an existing pipeline equipped with power and \n\ntelemetry (FM) \n \nThen, using historical and estimated VEP costs for each identified work breakdown category, SoCalGas compiled \ncosts for each project type by pipeline diameter.  SoCalGas then reviewed typical minimum and maximum costs to \nvalidate the averages.   \n \nSimilarly, material cost estimates were prepared based on recent purchase orders and release costs.

Mechanical contractors perform the mechanical and civil valve enhancement \nconstruction activities.  Valve automation contractors specialize in valve repair, modification and actuation.  Such \nwork includes fabrication and modification of existing valve extensions, valve servicing, and installation of \ngearboxes and actuators.  Valve automation contractors also perform the testing and commissioning of the valve \nto confirm proper installation and operation prior to placing (or returning) a valve to service.  Electrical contractors \nperform the electrical construction activities.  Such work includes installing panels, communication and power \nsystems and ground grids.  SoCalGas assumed the mechanical contractor will excavate for the electrical contractor, \nif a mechanical contractor is mobilized for that installation type. \n \nMechanical Contractor Assumptions \nFor each installation type, a list of work activities, or work breakdown structure, was generated for the mechanical \ncontractor.  The list of activities assumed for each installation type, except for the two backflow prevention project \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n327\n\n\n\ntypes\u2014 Types 7 and 8 (BFP1 and BFP2, respectively), is provided below.  For Type 7 (BFP1), the services of a \nmechanical contractor are not required.  For Type 8 (BFP2), SoCalGas assumed a percentage of total installed cost, \nbased on historical data. \n \n\n\u2022 Type 1 (C/P) \u2013 mobilization, facilities setup, site preparation, Best Management Practices (BMP) set-up, \nreceipt of materials, sense line excavation, electrical excavation, grounding excavation, sense line \nfabrication, pressure testing of sense lines, tie-in of sense lines, backfilling, electrical backfilling , site \nrestoration, breakdown of yard, demobilization, field overhead \n\n\u2022 Type 2 (A/AG) - mobilization, facilities setup, site preparation, BMP set-up, receipt of materials, demolition \nof fence/bollards, potholing, traffic control, sense line excavation, pipe excavation, electrical excavation, \ngrounding excavation, sense line fabrication, pressure testing of sense lines, tie-in of sense lines, actuator \ninstallation support, backfilling, electrical backfilling, site restoration, breakdown of yard, yard restoration, \nfoundation installation, demobilization, field overhead \n\n\u2022 Type 3 (A/VT) - mobilization, facilities setup, site preparation, BMP setup, receipt of materials, demolition \nof fence/bollards, potholing, traffic control, sense line excavation, vault excavation, pipe excavation, \nelectrical excavation, grounding excavation, sense line fabrication, vault installation, pressure testing of \nsense lines, tie-in of sense lines, actuator installation support, backfilling, electrical backfilling, site \nrestoration, breakdown of yard, yard restoration, foundation installation, demobilization, field overhead \n\n\u2022 Type 4 (NV/AG) - mobilization, facilities setup, site preparation, BMP setup, receipt of materials, demolition \nof fence/bollards, potholing, traffic control, sense line excavation, pipe excavation, bridle excavation, \nelectrical excavation, grounding excavation, valve assembly fabrication, sense line fabrication, pressure \ntesting of valve assembly, pressure testing of sense lines, isolation, demolition of pipe, tie-in of valve \nassembly, tie-in of sense lines, actuator installation support, coating, installation of pipe supports, \nbackfilling, electrical backfilling, site restoration, breakdown of yard, yard restoration, foundation \ninstallation, demobilization, field overhead \n\n\u2022 Type 5 (NV/VT) - mobilization, facilities setup, site preparation, BMP setup, receipt of materials, demolition \nof fence/bollards, potholing, traffic control, sense line excavation, vault excavation, pipe excavation, bridle \nexcavation, electrical excavation, grounding excavation, valve assembly fabrication, sense line fabrication, \npressure testing of valve assembly, pressure testing of sense lines, isolation, demolition of pipe, tie-in of \nvalve assembly, tie-in of sense lines, actuator installation support, coating, installation of pipe supports, \ninstallation of vault, backfilling, electrical backfilling, site restoration, breakdown of yard, yard restoration, \nfoundation installation, demobilization, field overhead \n\n\u2022 Type 6 (COMM) \u2013 mobilization, electrical excavation, grounding excavation, backfilling, site restoration, \ndemobilization, field overhead \n\n\u2022 Type 7 (BFP1) \u2013 none \n\u2022 Type 8 (BFP2) \u2013 none \n\u2022 Type 9 (FM) - mobilization, facilities setup, site preparation, BMP setup, receipt of materials, potholing, \n\nsense line excavation, vault excavation, electrical excavation, grounding excavation, sense line fabrication, \npressure testing of sense lines, tie-in of sense lines, installation of vault, backfilling, electrical backfilling, \nsite restoration, breakdown of yard, demobilization, field overhead \n\n \nHistorical averages and the PSEP estimating tool were used to generate cost estimates for each activity by pipe \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n328\n\n\n\ndiameter.  Data for a sampling of pipe diameters was used to create a trend line that was then used for pipe \ndiameters that were not sampled.  Costs were validated through comparison to historical PSEP projects.  \nAdjustments were made to estimated activity costs that appeared too low or too high, based on subject matter \nexpert input and the estimating tool. \n \nElectrical Contractor Assumptions \n \nElectrical contractor activities do not vary significantly from project to project and the estimated costs for electrical \ncontractors are much smaller than those for mechanical contractors.  Therefore, rather than prepare a detailed \nwork breakdown structure for electrical contractors that varies little from project to project, SoCalGas prepared \nelectrical contractor estimates using historical PSEP average costs and the PSEP estimating tool, by installation \ntype. \n \nValve Contractor Assumptions \n \nSimilar to electrical contractor costs, SoCalGas prepared estimates for valve contractor costs based on historical \nPSEP average costs and the PSEP estimating tool, by installation type.  \n \nEnvironmental Survey/Permitting/Monitoring \n\nProject Costs Prior to 2018 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total \n\nDIRECT LABOR $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nDIRECT NON-LABOR $83,199  $249,596  $1,386,646  $1,275,714  $1,164,783  $4,159,938  \nTOTAL DIRECT COSTS $83,199  $249,596  $1,386,646  $1,275,714  $1,164,783  $4,159,938  \n \nAssumptions/Forecast Methodology \nCosts for Environmental Services, Permitting and Monitoring, including, but not limited to, survey, permitting, \nmonitoring, and abatement activities, were assumed to be three percent of the total construction contractor cost.  \nThis percentage figure was derived using the estimating tool, which is based on historical averages. \n \nLand & Right-of-Way Acquisition \n\nProject Costs Prior to 2018 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total \n\nDIRECT LABOR $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nDIRECT NON-LABOR $83,199  $249,596  $1,386,646  $1,275,714  $1,164,783  $4,159,938  \nTOTAL DIRECT COSTS $83,199  $249,596  $1,386,646  $1,275,714  $1,164,783  $4,159,938  \n \nAssumptions/Forecast Methodology \nCosts for Land and Right-of-Way Acquisition activities, including, but not limited to, permitting, right-of-way \nacquisition, and temporary right-of-entry (TRE) acquisition, were assumed to be three percent of the total \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n329\n\n\n\nconstruction contractor cost.

Two percent of the total contractor cost was assumed for project management \ncompany labor.  Historical construction timelines with similar activity lists for each installation type were used to \nderive man-hour estimates for construction management company labor.  Finally, union company labor was \nderived using an estimating tool with appropriate work activities, by installation type.  For example, union \ncompany labor for new valve installations (Types 4 and 5\u2014NV/AG and NV/VT) include union company labor for \npipe isolation and tie-in work.   \n \nOther Capital Costs \n\nProject Costs Prior to 2018 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total \n\nDIRECT LABOR $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nDIRECT NON-LABOR $952,025  $2,856,079  $15,867,103  $14,597,735  $13,328,365  $47,601,307  \nTOTAL DIRECT COSTS $952,025  $2,856,079  $15,867,103  $14,597,735  $13,328,365  $47,601,307  \n \nAssumptions/Forecast Methodology \nOther Capital costs include contracted project management, engineering, survey, design services, and other costs.  \nCosts for project management were assumed to be eight percent of the total contractor cost.  Construction \nmanagement, similar to company labor construction management, uses historical construction timelines for each \ninstallation type to derive man-hour estimates.  The man-hour estimates were prepared for the construction \nmanager, inspectors and field engineers.  Surveying costs were assumed to be five percent of the total construction \ncontractor cost.

NV/AG was assumed to be the most similar of installation types to BFP2 as it has no vault \ninstallations.  A cost-per-day of construction was derived and applied to typical construction timelines for check \nvalve installations.  In this example, it is assumed that a  check valve installation on an existing pipeline \nwould take  10 days to construct.  At a cost-per-day rate of $39,000/day, total installed cost for the check valve \nis $390,000.  To breakdown the cost for each category, historical averages of those categories were used. \n\n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n338\n\n\n\n \n \n\nTABLE 11 \n \n\nProject Type 9 (FM)  \nInstallation of a New Vaulted Flow Meter on Any Size Pipeline  \n\nEquipped with Power and Telemetry5    \n\nAll units are in thousand dollars \nMaterials \u2013 Mechanical   $                  1  \nMaterials \u2013 Electrical   $               52  \nMaterials \u2013 Civil   $               42  \n\nTotal material costs  $          95    \nMechanical Contractor   $             406  \nElectrical Contractor   $               78  \nValve Contractor   -  \n\nTotal construction contractor costs  $        484    \nCompany Labor   $               74  \nEngineering   $               48  \nEnvironmental   $               15  \nProject Management   $               39  \nSurvey   $               24  \nConstruction Management   $               59  \nLand   $               15  \n     \nTotal Cost    $             852  \n\n \n\n5 As reflected in Table 2, Project Type 9 costs do not vary by pipe diameter. \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n339\n\n\n\n \n\nWP-V-A1-A79 \n\nFourth Year Project Workpapers \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n340\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL WORKPAPER SUMMARY 2019 GRC APPLICATION  \nFOURTH YEAR PROJECTS \n\n \n\n \nProject Line \n\nPipe \nDiameter \n\n(inch) \n\n \nPhase \n\n \nProject Type \n\n \nLine Type Total \n\nMiles \n\n \nO&M Costs \n\n \nCapital Costs \n\n \nTotal Cost \n\n \nWorkpaper \nPage \n\n225 North  2A Test Transmission 8.115 $10,885,577 $4,578,342 $15,463,919 WP-V-A1 \n\n1030  2A Test Transmission 25.788 $17,922,428 $7,432,801 $25,355,229 WP-V-A13 \n\n2001 West  2A Test Transmission 5.658 $6,995,704 $1,421,957 $8,417,661 WP-V-A25 \n\n2001 East  2A Test Transmission 27.433 $13,555,677 $7,894,423 $21,450,100 WP-V-A37 \n\n2005  2A Test Transmission 0.28 $2,519,309 $839,849 $3,359,158 WP-V-A49 \n\n2001 East \nReplacement \n\n 2A Replacement Transmission 0.073 $0 $3,798,756 $3,798,756 WP-V-A60 \n\n5000  2A Replacement Transmission 0.015 $0 $4,486,491 $4,486,491 WP-V-A70 \n\n44-1008 (50%)*  1B Replacement Distribution 54.858 $0 $76,581,831 $76,581,831 WP-III-A94 \n\n    Total 122.22 $51,878,695 $107,034,450 $158,913,145  \n\n* The forecast for Line 44-1008 represents 50% of the estimated project costs.

L-225 is a high pressure transmission \npipeline, this portion was installed in 1959.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe project is located in Los Angeles County, CA, beginning in Gorman, CA, near Highway 138, continuing southeast \nto Angeles National Forest.  The project consists of 7.359 miles of Phase 2A pipe and 0.756 miles of incidental pipe.  \nThe incidental pipe as has been included to improve constructability by minimizing the excavations, test breaks and \ntie-in work. \n \nThis project is divided into five individual hydrotest sections and three individual nitrogen test sections, the three \nsections that are being tested with nitrogen are spans located on this poriton of L-225.  Nitrogen is being used for \nthese sections because water cannot be used as the test medium due to weight limitations.  The hydrotest section \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n342\n\n\n\nsplits are based on test pressure limitations due to elevation changes.  The lowest and highest elevations are 3,050 \nfeet and 4,158 feet, respectively.  The entire 8.115-mile section of pipeline will be isolated to accommodate the \ntimely completion of all hydrostatic testing activities.  The capital work of this project includes the replacement of \ntwo valves to enable future piggability, and nine short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.  \nThis capital work totals to 592 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nLine 225 is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system.  Abandoning this line would create a substantial \nloss in capacity since L-225 is a critical pipeline to receive Rocky Mountain supplies and support customers in \nsouthern California, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  \nDerating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to \nmeet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In-Analysis \nLine 225 can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest from October 1st to November 15th and \nApril 1st to May 31st.  These timeframes are contingent upon full receiving capacity being available at the Southern \nand Northern zones, no limitations or restrictions on storage withdrawal, Wheeler Ridge being available to support \nthe San Joaquin Valley, and Honor Rancho being available to support the Los Angels Basin.  The line will be isolated \nthrough the shut-in of mainline valves.  There are two taps in total that will need to be isolated from L-225 prior to \nthe shutdown.  Both taps will require CNG support during the shut-in.  \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 59 working days. \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n343\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Map for Line 225 North \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 7.359 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0 \nINCIDENTAL 0.756 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 8.115 \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n344\n\n[image: image102.jpg] Gorman Post Rd Test Break 1 18 Quail Lake Test Break 2 138 Test Break 3 Old Ridge Route Ra Hungry Valley State Vehicle Recreation Area Governor Edmund G Brown West Branch California A Test Break 4 Test Break 5 225 North Hydrotest Test Break 6 Legend Test Break 7 .......

L-1030 is a high pressure transmission \npipeline, this portion was installed predominatly in 1955.  This portion of pipeline has an MAOP between 695 and \n\n psig. \n \nThe project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning at the end of Line 2001 East near Desert Center, CA, \ncontinuing west to where Line 2001 West begins dear Cottonwood Springs Rd.  The project consists of 25.434 miles \nof Phase 2A pipe, 0.340 miles of accelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.014 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe \nhas been included to facilitate constructability by minimizing the test breaks and welds. \n \nThis project is divided into 14 individual test sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.  The lowest \nand highest elevations are 820 feet and 1,750 feet, respectively.  The capital work of this project includes the \nreplacement of four taps, three anomaly repairs and 16 short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n354\n\n\n\nprocedure.  This capital work totals to 930 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjunction with L-2001 East and L-2001 West, L-1030 is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system \nbetween Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The abandonment of this section of L-1030 would result in a substantial \nloss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles \nBasin.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would \nreduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.  The \nline will be isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-\n2000 which is bridled to L-1030, there is no need for CNG support during this project. \n  \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                             \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 90 working days. \n \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n355\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for L-1030 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 25.434 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.340 \nINCIDENTAL 0.014 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 25.788 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n356\n\n[image: image105.jpg] 177 Desert Center Airport Test Break 8 Test Break 4 Test Break 7 Test Break 2 Test Break 16 Test Break 14 Test Break 11 Test Break 6 Test Break 3 Test Break 13 Test Break 12 Test Break 10 Test Break 9 Test Break 5 Besell Test Break 1 1030- stonwood springs Ro Test Break 15 Legend .....

L-2001 West is a high pressure \ntransmission pipeline, this portion was installed predominatly in 1953.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of \n\npsig.  L-2001 West was originally proposed in A.11-11-002  as one project consisting of 64.1 miles.  To execute \nthe project, Line 2001 West was divided into the following projects: L-2001W-A, L-2001W-B, L-2001W-C, L-2001W-\nD, L-2001W-E and L-2001W. \n \nThe L-2001 West project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning east of Chiriaco Summit, CA, continuing west \nto the Cactus City Station.  The entire length of this project consists of Phase 2A pipe. \n \nThe project is divided into 3 individual test sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.  The lowest \nand highest elevations are 1,355 feet and 1,520 feet, respectively.  The capital work of this project includes the \nreplacement of four short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.  This capital work totals to 190 \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n366\n\n\n\nfeet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjuction with L-2001 East and L-1030, L-2001 West is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system \nbetween Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The abandonment of this section of L-2001 West would result in a \nsubstantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the \nLos Angeles Basin.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% \nSMYS would reduce the the capacity of the system resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is \nnot an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotest during the summer months.  The line will \nbe isolated through the shut-in of mainline valves.  During the outage, customers can be supplied via L-2000 which \nis bridled to L-2001W, there is no need for CNG support during this project. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.        \n                                                                        \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 57 working days. \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n367\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for L-2001 West \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 5.658 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.000 \nINCIDENTAL 0.000 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 5.658 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n368\n\n[image: image108.jpg] Joshua Tree National Park tage Rd Test Break 4 10 Test Break 3 2001 WEST Test Break 2 10 Test Break 1 rline Rd Canyon Powerline Rd Red Canyon Legend Red Canyon Tri ....

L-2001 East is a high pressure \ntransmission pipeline, this portion was installed predominatly in 1954.  This portion of the pipeline has an MAOP of \n\n psig. \n \nThe L-2001 East project is located in Riverside County, CA, beginning outside of Mesa Verde, CA, continuing west \nending a few miles east of Desert Center, CA.  The project consists of 27.278 miles of Phase 2A pipe, 0.151 miles of \naccelerated Phase 2B pipe, and 0.004 miles of incidental pipe.  The incidental pipe has been  included to facilitate \nconstruction by minimizing the test-breaks and welds. \n \nThe project is divided into 11 individual test sections to address limitations due to elevation changes.  The lowest \nand highest elevations are 355 feet and 825 feet, respectively.  The capital work of this project includes the \nreplacement of one tap and 12 short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.  This capital work \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n378\n\n\n\ntotals to 665 feet. \n \nAlternatives Considered \nIn conjuction with L-2001 West and L-1030, L-2001 East is a primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system \nbetween Blythe, CA and Los Angeles, CA.  The abandonment of this section of L-2001 East would result in a \nsubstantial loss in capacity to the Desert & Southern Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the \nLos Angeles Basin.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting \nin an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an option . \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.  \nDuring the outage, customers served by regulator stations within the isolated section will be supplied by L-2000 \nwhich is bridled to L-2001 at those locations. \n  \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                                    \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 81 working days. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n379\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for L-2001 East \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 27.278 \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0.151 \nINCIDENTAL 0.004 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 27.433 \n\n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n380\n\n[image: image111.jpg] Test Break 12 Test Break 11 Test Break 10 Test Break 9 Test Break 8 Test Break 7 Test Break 6 Test Break Test Break 4 -2001-EAST Test Break 3 Test Break 2 Test Break 1 Legend .co.

L-2005 is a high pressure transmission \npipeline that was installed in 1950.  The pipeline has an MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe L-2005 project takes place in Riverside County, CA, beginning in the Moreno Small Station and continuing \nsouth to the Moreno Large Station.  The entire length of this project consists of Phase 2A pipe. \n \nThe project is to be tested in one segment due to negligible elevation changes over the length of the hydrotest.  \nThe lowest and highest elevations are 1,557 feet and 1,580 feet, respectively.  The capital work of this project \nincludes the replacement of two short sections of pipe to facilitate the hydrotesting procedure.  This capital work \ntotals to 72 feet. \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n390\n\n\n\nAlternatives Considered \nLine 2005 is the primary tie-over from L-2001 West to L-2000 to feed gas from the SoCalGas transmission system to \nSan Diego.  The abandonment of L-2005 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the San Diego Transmission \nZone since gas moves from Blythe towards San Diego via this route.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable \noption.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS would reduce the capacity of the system resulting in an \ninability to meet customer demand and also is not an option. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line section can be temporarily taken out of service to perform the hydrotests during the summer months.  \nThere are no customers within the hydrotest segment that must be considered before an outage could be \nimplemented.  However, L-2005 is a tie-over pipeline from L-2001 West to L-2000, duringthe outage, customers \nserved by the L-2005 tie-over will be supplied solely by L-2000. \n  \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction.                                                                                \n \nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is assumed to span 43 working days. \n \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n391\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for L-2005 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 0.280 \nACCELERATED PHASE 2B 0.000 \nINCIDENTAL 0.000 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 0.280 \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n392\n\n[image: image114.png] 31008 Alessandro Blud Alessandro Test Break 1 Virginia St 2005 Legend .cow Accelerated Phase 2B xxxXX Incidental Virginia St Abandon Replace Test Break 2 Test - Pipeline 0 100 200 400 Feet Sources: Esri, HERE, Delorme, USGS, Intermap, INCREMENT P, NRCan, Esri Japan, METI, Esri China (Hong Kong), Esri Korea, Esri (Thailand), MapmyIndia, NGCC, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS User Community \n\n\n\nProject Satellite Map for L-2005 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n393\n\n[image: image115.jpg] Alessandro Divd Alessandro Virginia St 2005 Legend Abandon Replace Test Line 0 50 100 200 Feet Esh.

This portion of the pipeline has a MAOP of  psig. \n \nThe L-5000 project is located in Riverside County, CA and takes place entirely within the Blythe Compressor Station.  \nThe entirety of the replacement is Phase 2A pipe. \n \nThe majority of the pipe will be installed above ground with a small section, approximately 10 feet, being installed \nbelow ground via open trench.  \n \nAlternatives Considered \nLine 5000 is the primary feed to the SoCalGas transmission system between Blythe, CA and the Moreno Large \nStation.  The abandonment of this section of L-5000 would result in a substantial loss in capacity to the Desert, \nSouthern, and San Diego Transmission Zones since gas moves from Blythe towards the Los Angeles Basin and to \nSan Diego.  Because of this, abandonment is not a viable option.  Derating the pipeline to less than 20% SMYS \nwould reduce the capacity of the pipeline, resulting in an inability to meet customer demand and also is not an \noption. \n \nShut-In Analysis \nThe line section can be taken out of service to perform the replacement during the summer months.  The \nreplacement section of L-5000 will be isolated using stopples to divert gas and maintain flow through the station.  \nMain line valves will be used to isolate the section of L-2001 that ties into L-5000.  There are no customers on this \nsegement and therefore CNG support will not be required. \n \nForecast Methodology \nSoCalGas developed a Total Installed Cost (TIC) estimate to implement the above scope of work.  The TIC estimate \nincludes direct costs associated with project management, engineering and design, environmental permitting, land \nacquisition, material and equipment procurement, and construction. \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n411\n\nsnchoon\nHighlight\n\n\n\nSchedule \nThe schedule was developed based on the seven stage project life cycle described in testimony.  As defined in \ntestimony, key project deliverables were identified and incorporated into a work breakdown structure.  This work \nbreakdown structure was then sequenced, and predecessor and successor tasks were linked.  Estimated durations \nwere established for each task to derive a total project timeline. \n \nAs described in greater detail below, the preliminary Construction Schedule is estimated to be 40 working days. \n \n \n \n  \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n412\n\n\n\nProject Overview Map for L-5000 \n \n\n \n \n\nPROJECT MILEAGE TABLE \n \n\nPHASE MILEAGE \nPHASE 2A 79 feet \nACCELERATED - PHASE 2B 0 \nINCIDENTAL 0 \nTOTAL MILEAGE 79 feet \n\n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n413\n\n[image: image123.png] 2001 EAST Legend accion Accelerated Phase 2B xXXXX Incidental 2001 Abandon EAST Replace Test 5000(1) ST10 Pipeline 0 25 50 100 Feet Sources: Esri, HERE, Delorme, USGS, Intermap, INCREMENT P, NRCan, Esri Japan, METI, Esri China (Hong Kong), Esri Korea, Esri (Thailand), MapmyIndia, NGCC, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS User Community \n\n\n\nProject Satellite Map for L-5000 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSouthern California Gas Company \n2019 GRC APP\n\n414\n\n[image: image124.jpg] 2001 EAST Legend 2001 EAST Abandon 5000(1) ST10 Replace Test Line 0 25 50 100 Feet Esri, HERE, DeLorme, Mapmyindia, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, Esri, HERE, DeLorme, MapmyIndia, @ OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS user community, Source: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus DS, USDA, USGS, AeroGRID, IGN, and the GIS User Community \n\n\n\nThe direct costs for each area are summarized below. \n \nMaterial \n\nProject Costs Prior to 2019* 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total \n\nDIRECT LABOR $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nDIRECT NON-LABOR $0  $0  $0  $0 $654,932  $654,932  \nTOTAL DIRECT COSTS $0  $0  $0  $0 $654,932  $654,932  \n \nAssumptions \nMaterials for this project will not be purchased until final internal authorization is obtained.

A \nfive-year historical average represents a reasonable basis to estimate operational needs for TY \n2019 because Supplier Diversity\u2019s costs are generally prone to fluctuations due to changes in \nwork activities, which impact staffing levels, purchased service costs, and other factors. As such, \nSupplier Diversity uses a five-year historical average, which reflects the variances in costs from \nyear-to-year and represents a reasonable basis to estimate operational needs for TY 2019. \n\n\n\nNDC-SEU DATA REQUEST-001 \nSOCALGAS- SDG&E 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-11-007/8 \n\nDATE RECEIVED:   MARCH 2, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  MARCH 20, 2018 \n\n \n9. What accounts for the higher ($812,000) labor cost for SDGE\u2019s supplier diversity category in \n2014? (SDGE-20-WP at 28)  \n \nUtilities Response 9: \n \nIn 2014, the scope of the Supplier Diversity team included Supplier Relationship Management \nand additional FTEs were needed to address the added workload. In 2015, the two additional \nFTEs transitioned back into other functions within Supply Management. The five-year historical \naverage forecast methodology is still appropriate as these FTEs were retained within the Supply \nManagement organization and the methodology was consistently applied across the entire \norganization.  \n\n\n\nNDC-SEU DATA REQUEST-001 \nSOCALGAS- SDG&E 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-11-007/8 \n\nDATE RECEIVED:   MARCH 2, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  MARCH 20, 2018 \n\n \n10.

(SDGE-20-WP at 28)  \n \nUtilities Response 10: \n \nDuring 2012 and 2013, Supplier Diversity utilized more purchased labor for consulting; \nadditionally, the team participated in more outreach activities. Since 2014, our focus has been \nmore internal; creating a stronger team of Champions and Ambassadors to drive the Supplier \nDiversity results. \n \n\n\n\nNDC-SEU DATA REQUEST-001 \nSOCALGAS- SDG&E 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-11-007/8 \n\nDATE RECEIVED:   MARCH 2, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  MARCH 20, 2018 \n\n \n11.

(SDGE-20-WP at 29)  \n \nUtilities Response 11: \n \nThe forecast adjustment of $100,000 for 2018 and 2019 represents costs required to ramp up our \nrecruitment efforts for suppliers in underutilized areas, increase efforts for supplier development \nand expansion in highly specialized areas of the company such as Energy Storage and Smart \nGrid Technologies.  \n\n\n\nNDC-SEU DATA REQUEST-001 \nSOCALGAS- SDG&E 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-11-007/8 \n\nDATE RECEIVED:   MARCH 2, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  MARCH 16, 2018 \n\n \n12.

Last year 312 diverse firms participated in these programs. \n \nIn 2017, we launched three new technical assistance and development pilot programs for existing \ndiverse suppliers and other interested businesses. The content of the pilot programs were based \non a survey of former technical assistance program participants (Mastering Business Growth), \nand feedback we received during a focus group study.  This study was conducted to evaluate the \neffectiveness of our existing programs and launch new programs that were just as effective and \nrelative to todays business environment. Our goal was also to further enhance our programs and \nimplement a more targeted approach for our existing and potential suppliers.   \n \nThe goals for our technical assistance programs, which we believe we have met, are to \neffectively help the business owner to: \n\n \n\u2022 Identify areas of improvement, create a plan to enhance performance and provide \n\nfollowup at specified intervals to monitor progress \n\u2022 Improve strategic thinking, business tactics and to align goals and stay adaptable \n\u2022 Help owners resume business after a major crisis, including natural disasters and a cyber \n\nbreach \n\u2022 Enhance finance skills and business development \n\u2022 Expand beyond core capabilities and prepare  diverse businesses to scale up their \n\noperations \n\u2022 Improve effectiveness of leadership, negotiations and social media \n\u2022 Enhance management skills and develop a business improvement plan \n\u2022 For smaller business owners, develop business plan writing skills, learn book keeping, \n\nimprove capabilities statement, social media, branding and business tax filing \n \n \nAll participants are required to complete a survey at the end of each course so we can continue to \nmeasure its effectiveness. \n \n\n\n\nNDC-SEU DATA REQUEST-001 \nSOCALGAS- SDG&E 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-11-007/8 \n\nDATE RECEIVED:   MARCH 2, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  MARCH 20, 2018 \n\n \n18.

We launched a Supplier Segmentation Strategy to better align our technical assistance \nprograms and opportunities with our suppliers\u2019 needs.  The strategy places diverse suppliers into \nfour categories.  The categories are based on revenues and provides a more customized approach \nto technical assistance, mentoring and on-the-job-training opportunities.   \n \nKey components of our strategy include identifying new suppliers that support SoCalGas\u2019 \nbusiness needs and targeting assistance to companies in each of the segments below: \n \nDiscover \u2013 These are new suppliers we find through outreach efforts who can provide goods and \nservices in underutilized areas of the Company. \n \nDevelop \u2013 These are companies ranging in revenues up to $5 million that will benefit from \nprograms such as our Small Contractor Opportunity Realization Effort (SCORE), development \nof strategic growth plan, and will receive mentoring and on-the-job-training.  Specific technical \nassistance programs have been developed to address the needs of this segment. \n \nGrow \u2013 This segment consists of companies in the revenue range of greater than $5 million and \nup to $10 million.  We are focused on building capacity and sustaining growth with suppliers in \nthis segment.  These companies are prepared to transition from a sub-contractor to a prime \nsupplier at SoCalGas. \n \nSustain \u2013 These are our largest suppliers with revenues greater than $10 million.  We are striving \nto develop true strategic partners that will ensure price competitiveness, help us minimize risk \nand share best industry practices in this segment. \n \nWe will continue our aggressive approach in our outreach and will identify qualified suppliers \nthat have the capacity to do business with SoCalGas.  Through the above segmented approach, \ncapacity building and growth of our diverse firms continue to be one of our major goals.  \n \nIn addition, we have added several new progams such as:  Meet The Primes, Safety Congress, \nSupplier Engagement Forum, SCORE, Turning Contacts into Contracts and Supplier Diversity \nChampions Program.  We plan on utilizing these same programs in 2018. \n \n\n\n\nNDC-SEU DATA REQUEST-001 \nSOCALGAS- SDG&E 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-11-007/8 \n\nDATE RECEIVED:   MARCH 2, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  MARCH 20, 2018 \n\n \n19.

In Response to CUE-DR13-Q347, SoCalGas responded that it does not have \n\nhourly level of service reports and that hourly level of service is only maintained for \n\nthe most recent 30 days. \n\n \n\n(a) Please provide the hourly level of service for the most recent 30 days. \n\n(b) Please explain how SoCalGas calculates annual level of service data if the \n\nhourly level of service is only maintained for the most recent 30 days. \n\n(c) Please explain why SoCalGas discards this data. \n\n(d) What is the dollar savings from discarding this data? \n\n \n\nSCG\u2019s Response 351: \n\n \n\nFor the purpose of this response, SoCalGas assumes that this question is referring to the response \n\nto data request CUE-SCG-DR11 Q347 and with that clarification, SoCalGas responds as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n\n(a) See file CUE-SCG-DR-13 Attachment Q351 for the requested information. \n\n(b)  Level of service (LOS) is calculated by dividing the number of CSR calls answered  \n\nwithin 60 seconds by the total CSR calls offered.  These daily numbers are tracked and \n\nstored each day to enable SoCalGas to calculate the daily, monthly and annual LOS.  \n\nHourly Level of Service numbers are not needed to calculate the annual level of service. \n\n \n\n(c)  SoCalGas tracks LOS on a daily, monthly and annual basis.  There is an on-demand \n\nreport that is run three times a day to observe the daily LOS.  The LOS team uses this \n\nreport to determine if changes need to be made to CSR staffing for the day, which may \n\ninclude early releases, offers of overtime or to pull in additional CSR resources. Hourly \n\ndata is not used for other purposes. Please also refer to SoCalGas\u2019 response to CUE-\n\nSCG-DR-13 Q. 351(b).  \n\n \n\n(d)  Since SoCalGas does not utilize hourly data beyond the intra-day review described in \n\nresponse to CUE-SCG-DR-13 Q. 351(c), it does not incur any production expenses and \n\nhas no quantifiable cost savings associated with discarding the data.   \n\n \n\n\n\nCUE DATA REQUEST \n\nCUE-SCG-DR-13 \n\nUTILITIES 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-10-008 \n\nSOCALGAS / SDG&E RESPONSE \n\nDATE RECEIVED:  JUNE 12, 2018 \n\nDATE RESPONDED:  JUNE 27, 2018 \n \n\n352. Following up on the Response to CUE-DR13-Q348: \n\n \n\n(a) Pleas explain the weighting that leads to the average monthly \n\nabandonment rate. \n\n(b) Please explain why the averages monthly abandonment rate is not the \n\nsimple average. \n\n(c) Please provide, in Excel format, an expanded response to CUE-DR13-Q348 \n\nthat includes in addition to the abandonment rate, broken down by year, \n\nmonth and day for the last five years: \n\n(i) the total number of calls that day; and \n\n(ii) the number of abandoned calls that day. \n\n \n\nSCG\u2019s Response 352: \n\n \n\nFor the purpose of this response, SoCalGas assumes that this question is referring to the response \n\nto data request CUE-SCG-DR11 Q348 and with that clarification, SoCalGas responds as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n\n(a) The abandonment rate is calculated by dividing the number of CSR abandoned calls \n\nby the total CSR calls offered.  This is the calculation for daily, monthly and annual \n\nrates.   \n\n \n\n(b) Since SoCalGas does not receive the same number of CSR Offered Calls each day, it \n\nis not mathematically correct to take an average of the daily abandonment rates \n\n(simple average) to determine the monthly abandonment rate.   \n\n \n\n(c) See file CUE-SCG-DR-13 Attachment Q352 for the requested information. \n\n \n\n\n", "metadata_storage_content_type": "application/pdf", "metadata_storage_size": 915109, "metadata_storage_last_modified": "2020-01-07T20:21:56Z", "metadata_storage_path": "https://grcdocsstorage.blob.core.windows.net/rawdata/CUE%20SCG%20DR-13%20Q%20349-352%20combined.pdf", "metadata_storage_name": "CUE SCG DR-13 Q 349-352 combined.pdf", "metadata_content_type": "application/pdf", "metadata_language": "en", "metadata_title": "DRA DATA REQUEST", "keyPhrases": ["average days", "number of days", "CUE-DR13", "CUE DATA REQUEST", "calendar days", "response times", "E RESPONSE", "attachment CUE-SCG", "SCG\u2019s Response", "DATE", "data points", "time schedule SoCalGas", "number of times", "SDG", "UTILITIES", "GRC", "goal of SoCalGas Customer Services - Field", "monthly average", "Order Category", "DR13 Attachment", "A1 orders", "A2 priority orders", "order categories", "Q345", "following", "regular business hours", "scheduling of orders", "highest priority gas emergency order", "average of compiled daily snapshots", "minutes", "hourly level of service reports", "D2 categories", "DR11 Q346", "system summary table", "bases x", "customer\u2019s", "Q347", "months", "Q349", "B1", "Total", "purpose", "clarification", "holidays", "SoCalGas", "annual level of service data", "Hourly Level of Service numbers", "annual LOS", "data request CUE-SCG", "daily numbers", "days", "file CUE-SCG", "total CSR calls", "number of CSR calls", "DR11 Q347", "Attachment Q351", "requested information", "dollar savings", "seconds", "CUE-DR13", "data request CUE-SCG", "CUE DATA REQUEST", "file CUE-SCG", "SCG-DR", "expanded response", "E RESPONSE", "number of CSR", "SCG\u2019s Response", "averages monthly abandonment rate", "day review", "daily abandonment rates", "total CSR calls", "SoCalGas tracks LOS", "total number of calls", "number of abandoned calls", "daily LOS", "hourly data", "CSR staffing", "simple average", "additional CSR resources", "DR11 Q348", "LOS team", "DATE", "annual basis", "Attachment Q352", "overtime", "Excel format", "requested information", "weighting", "clarification", "SDG", "times", "quantifiable cost savings", "early releases", "calculation", "production expenses", "UTILITIES", "GRC", "Pleas", "changes", "purposes", "demand"], "persons": ["GRC", "GRC"], "organizations": ["CUE DATA", "SOCALGAS", "SCG", "SoCalGas", "SoCalGas Customer Services - Field", "CSR", "SoCalGas", "LOS", "CSR", "CUE", "CUE DATA", "SOCALGAS", "SCG"], "locations": ["CUE", "D-1"], "language": "en"}, {"@search.score": 0.28218955, "id": "QwBVAEUALQBTAEUAVQAtAEQAUgAtADAANABfAFEAXwAyADQAMQBfAEYAaQBuAGEAbAAuAHAAZABmAA2", "content": "\nCUE DATA REQUEST \n\nCUE-SEU-DR-04 \n\nUTILITIES 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-10-007/008 \n\nSOCALGAS / SDG&E RESPONSE PARTIAL  \n\nDATE RECEIVED:  JANUARY 8, 2018 \n\nDATE RESPONDED:  JANUARY 30, 2018 \n\n \n\n241.

Gas Acquisition\n\nGas Acquisition Activities: 1) procurement of natural gas supplies (including storage gas) for SCG and \n\nSDG&E core customers; 2) physical and financial hedging activity for the combined portfolio; 3) \n\nprocurement of green house gas emissions allowances for end-use customers and SCG covered facilities; \n\n4) sale of low carbon fuel standard credits; 5) contract management related to physical and financial gas \n\ntransactions, interstate transportation capacity, intrastate transportation capacity, and carbon trading; 6) IT \n\napplications and desktop computing support; 7) portfolio risk management; 8) economic / market analysis; \n\n9) counterparty settlements; 10) gas and carbon accounting; and 11) maintenance of a robust system of \n\ninternal business controls.\n\nActivity Description:\n\nLabor - Base YR Rec\n\nForecast Methodology: Base Year Recorded\n\nBase Year Recorded is the most appropriate labor forecasing methodology as Base Year 2016 staffing \n\nlevel expectations (adjusted for vacancies) are anticipated to remain unchanged even though additional \n\nactivities and responsibilities have been absorbed by Gas Acquisition (i.e. AB32 cap & trade procurement \n\nresponsibilities and low carbon fuel standard transactions). Full staffing level is necessary to operate \n\neffectively and to provide reliable, low-cost gas supplies for core customers.\n\nForecast Explanations:\n\nNon-Labor - 5-YR Average\n\nForecast Methodology: 5-YR Average\n\nGas Acquisition's non-labor O&M costs consist primarily of industry publication subscription fees, \n\nconsultants and on-line services, training, attendance at industry conferences and associated travel \n\nexpenses.  5-YR Average is the most appropriate methodology for non-labor O&M forecasting as the \n\nmethodology reduces anomalies occuring over the forecast period.  As an example the impact of reduced \n\ntraining and conference attendance activity in a certain year due to workload restrictions would not be \n\nrepresentative of a typical year's O&M non-labor spend.

In response to data request ORA-SCG-037-LMW Q4f, SCG provided in service dates \nfor the Chatsworth, Compton, Anaheim, and Pico Rivera facilities, noting that the \nforecasted Compton upgrades are delayed until 09/30/2018. Based on this, please \nprovide/answer the following: \n\n \na. For each of these facility improvements, provide a timeline indicating when the \nproject will commence and be completed inclusive of milestones (e.g., request \nfor proposals developed/completed, contractors approved, furniture ordered, \netc). \n \nb. For each of these forecasted facility improvements has management approved \nthe project? If yes, provide the level of approval.

If no, then why? \n \ne. For each of these forecasted facility improvements, has any furniture been \nordered? If no, then why? \n \nf. Provide an explanation why the Compton improvements completion date has \nbeen accelerated by 6 months. \n \ng. Have any of the Compton improvements started? If yes, please advise what \nimprovements have been started. \n \nh. With the known asbestos and heavy metal exposure in Compton, Anaheim, and \nPico Rivera why has SCG management delayed the upgrades given these \nupgrades were requested in the last rate-case? \n \n \n \n\n\n\nORA DATA REQUEST \nORA-SCG-122-LMW \n\nSOCALGAS 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-10-008 \nSOCALGAS RESPONSE \n\nDATE RECEIVED:  FEBRUARY 6, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  FEBRUARY 23, 2018 \n\n \ni. Based on review of SCG\u2019s 5 years of historical data, ORA noted there were no \ncosts recorded for facility renovations (00653B). Why are there no costs \nrecorded? Were there any facility renovation costs for those historic years? \n \nj. In the last GRC, did SCG request recovery for facility renovations? If no, then \nwhy? If yes, please provide the amount by year by facility project requested and \nthe amounts approved by the Commission. \n\n \n \nSoCalGas Response 1:  \n \na. Generally, SoCalGas\u2019 GRC Application includes capital forecasts for assets projected to be in-\nservice by the test year.  These forecasts represent SoCalGas\u2019 projection of the expenditures over \nthe GRC forecast period, and forecasts are reviewed and approved by management.  The duration \nbetween the development of the GRC project forecasts and the planned in-service date can be \nthree or more years. For example, a forecast for a project in the TY2016 GRC may have been \ndeveloped in late 2013 with a projected in-service date in 2016.  As emergent and unanticipated \nwork or circumstances arises subsequent to the preparation and submittal of the GRC Application, \nSoCalGas may reprioritize or re-allocate capital work within and across areas in a manner \nconsistent with providing safe and reliable services.  Since the data request ORA-SCG-037-\nLMW, the holistic view phase has been completed and based on the results of that phase (see \nresponse to 1.c. for more detail about the holistic view phase), SoCalGas will increase the scope \nof the Pico Rivera, Monterey Park, and Bakersfield facilities and delay the upgrades to the \nCompton and Chatsworth facilities.  Accordingly, a project schedule for Compton and \nChatsworth are not available.  The project schedule inclusive of milestones is not available for the \nAnaheim facility, however, an initial draft architectural plan has been completed. \n  \nb. See response to 1.a. \n \nc. The holistic view is complete, inclusive of initial architectural plans and drawings.   Holistic \nview in this instance is meant to describe an approach that looks across all of SoCalGas\u2019 regional \nheadquarters to determine optimal utilization and appropriate work group co-location at each \nfacility while working to maximize space efficiencies. This holistic approach allows SoCalGas to \nmaximize use of our existing facilities and will be leveraged to prioritize and refine the scope for \nfacilities renovation projects.  \n \nd. SoCalGas has hired architectural design firms to create plans and drawings for these sites as \nwell as completed the holistic view study of the regional headquarters.  Please see response to \n1.a., above. \n \ne. No. These projects are not yet at the stage where furniture would be ordered. Typically, \nfurniture is ordered 12 weeks ahead of installation.   \n\n\n\nORA DATA REQUEST \nORA-SCG-122-LMW \n\nSOCALGAS 2019 GRC \u2013 A.17-10-008 \nSOCALGAS RESPONSE \n\nDATE RECEIVED:  FEBRUARY 6, 2018 \nDATE RESPONDED:  FEBRUARY 23, 2018 \n\n \nf. The Compton improvements were delayed, not accelerated, to accommodate the completion of \nthe holistic view study.  Please see response to 1.a., above.  \n \ng. No.  \n \nh. SoCalGas objects to this request on the grounds that it assumes facts not in evidence and lacks \nfoundation.  Exhibit SCG-23 does not state that there is known asbestos and heavy metal \nexposure.  SoCalGas also objects to this request on the grounds that the term \u201cexposure\u201d is vague \nand ambiguous.  There is a difference between exposure and abatement.  Subject to and without \nwaiving these objections, SoCalGas responds as follows:  The abatement of asbestos and heavy \nmetals is only necessary as part of construction (and thus impacts the forecasted renovation costs).  \nAbatement is not required if the materials are left undisturbed.  \n \ni.  Various facility renovation projects were completed during the 2012 \u2013 2016 period. However, \nthese projects roll-up to the 00653 budget category listed in the 5-year historical data.
